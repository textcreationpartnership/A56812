            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thou art one, who indeed liveſt in the belief of a future Life, an Eternity of happineſs or miſery, when time and days ſhall be more, I am confident the enſuing Diſcourſe will be grateful and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com to thee: I make no Apology for its plainneſs, nor am I at all ſolicitous touching the cenſures I may fall under for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: If thou wilt read it with an upright heart, I queſtion not, but through a bleſſing from above, it may do thy Soul good; ſure I am, thou wilt find the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument moſt weighty, and the Concern thereof moſt important: and woe be to that ſoul which miſſeth the deſign it tends to, and aims at. When men come to die, and do find themſelves launching forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vaſt Ocean of Eternity, at leaſt when once they find themſelves incircled in that
<pb facs="tcp:41049:4"/>Ocean, (which quickly they do, when once Death makes its approach) then they ſee that their great intereſt lay beyond this poor, vain, periſhing World, and the things thereof; then they ſee that their Great Concern was to have look'd and liv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond time and days, and have made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for an Eternal ſtate: but alas! alas! then 'tis too late, too late: then they cry out, O Eternity, Eternity! O miſerable ſouls that we are! how did ſin and the world blind and bewitch us, that we could not ere now, when 'tis too late, ſee the weight of an Eternal Intereſt! O blind and bruitiſh Creatures, that were taken with carnal and ſenſual things, things pleaſing only to a ſenſual appetite; and forgot God, the chief Good, the things of Heaven, and a bleſſed Eternity, which would have made us happy for ever: Now to prevent theſe doleful lamentations, and ſuch a diſmal and remedileſs ſhipwrack of Eternal Souls, as alſo to ſhew them the path of Life, and to engage them to make ſure of a bleſſed Eternity, while time and days laſt, is the deſign of the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and of the dying Author in it. And the Lord, the God of all Grace, proſper it in order thereunto. God has kept me for
<pb facs="tcp:41049:4"/>a full half year by the Graves ſide; one while lifting me up, then caſting me down, and now he ſeems to be ſpeedily finiſhing my days: to whom, through the infinite riches of free Grace, I can with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and boldneſs ſay; Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly, Amen. And now farewel vain World, farewel Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, farewel eating and drinking, and bleſſed be God, farewel ſin and ſinning: within a few days I ſhall ſin no more, nor ever be in a poſſibility of ſinning; but ſhall be like my Lord, and ſhall ſee him as he is: And laſtly, farewel Reader.</p>

               <p>TO walk with God here on earth, while we live; and to be ready to live with God for ever in Heaven, when we come to die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Great Work we have to do, the Great Concern we have to mind, in our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41049:7"/>preſent Pilgrimage. To grow great and high in the World, to build our Names and Families, to live a life of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures and delights, ſpending our dayes in mirth; theſe are low, mean, poor things; things infinitely beneath the dignity of a ſoul, and altogether unworthy of the leaſt of its care and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude: but to know God, to love God, to obey God, to delight in God, to contemplate the glorious excellencies and perfections of God, to live upon God, and to live to God; upon him as our chief good and happineſs, and to him as our laſt end; and withall to be found ready at laſt to live with him for ever, to enter upon the beatifical Viſion, and to paſs into that life of love and holineſs; which the Saints and Angels live above, being made perfect in the Viſion and Fruition of the God of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this is truly noble, this is worthy of the care and ſolicitude of Souls: to promote theſe things, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the latter, is my deſign in fixing my Meditations on this Scripture, which I am the rather induced to do, becauſe I am apprehenſive, that the time of my going hence, when I ſhal be ſeen no more,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41049:7"/>is drawing very nigh. The words are, a holy and pathetical wiſh and deſire, breathed out into the boſom of God by the man after his own heart: and that when under ſore and heavy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: under grievous ſickneſs, ſay ſome: under great ſtraits and diſtreſſes, by reaſon of <hi>Abſolon</hi>'s rebellion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt him, ſay others.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41049:8"/>World, and bid adieu to this mortal life, to be no more in the Land of the Living, to be no more in this World, to do any thing for God or my Soul: for (as one well obſerves) <hi>David</hi> doth not here ſuppoſe Death to be the utter end, or annihilation of man, the putting of man out of being: but his meaning is, if God did ſtill go on to afflict him, as he had done, he muſt ſuddenly die, ſuddenly go off the Stage of this World, and go down to the Bars of Death, to the Gates of the Grave: where, as to any thing that is to be done for God, or a man's Soul, it is, as if he were out of being; and where he will be kept for ever from returning any more to this life, or any opportunity of ever doing any thing for another World, It is a phraſe like to, and of the ſame importance with that, <hi>Job</hi> 16.22. where <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf: <hi>When a few years are come; then ſhall I go the way, whence I ſhall not return: Not return,</hi> that is, not any more to this life; not return to do any thing for GOD or my Soul: The ſum of the whole ſeems to be thus much; the good man's afflictions were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41049:9"/>ſo preſſing and heavy upon him; that they did even bow him down to the Grave; and he really looked upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a dying man, as one going down to the duſt of the Death: where he knew full well, nothing was to be done for another life, and from whence there was no return to this life to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any more; and therefore he begs a breathing time, a little ſpace, wherein to recover himſelf out of all preſent diſtempers and diſcompoſures of heart, and to ſet all things right in the matters of his ſoul; thereby fitting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf the better for his departure out of this World: he begs a time of reſpite, wherein to prepare himſelf, and make ready for a dying hour: this is the ſum of what he drives at, and pleads with God for: accordingly the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therein the ſum of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment ſhall be this.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That 'tis a very deſirable thing and a buſineſs of the higheſt moment and importance to the Children of Men, to have all things ſet right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well ordered, and compoſed in the matters of their ſouls, before they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41049:9"/>leave this World; to get all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual concerns of their Souls into the beſt poſture they can, before a dying hour comes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> An holy man, a man in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, yea <hi>a man after God's own heart,</hi> doth yet (you ſee) pray for ſparing mercy, for a breathing-time, a time of reſpite, here in this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goeth off the Stage: and why ſo? <hi>That he might recover ſtrength,</hi> that he might ſet things right in the matters of his Soul; that he might make himſelf more ready, and get his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concerns into a better poſture, for a dying hour; and this he looked at, and made out after, as that which was moſt deſirable, and of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to him, as indeed 'tis to all. You have a Scripture not unlike to this, Job 10.20, 21. <hi>Are not my dayes few? ceaſe then, and let me alone; that I may take comfort a little; before I go, whence I ſhall not return, even to the Land of Darkneſs, and of the ſhadow of Death:</hi> That I may take comfort a little; that I may recover a little, that I may have a breathing time, that I may recover my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41049:10"/>ſelf, and gather up my Spirits; ſo I find the phraſe expounded. He ſeems to deſire a breathing time; the better to compoſe himſelf, and the matters of his Soul, for a dying hour. And indeed 'tis the concern of us all, to ſet all things right in our ſouls, and to get into the readieſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that poſſibly we can, againſt a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour comes. I ſhall firſt briefly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this truth, and then make ſome practical improvement of it.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein is ſhewen the exceeding great weight of dying Work, and extream difficulty of a dying hour, as the firſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Aſſertion.</head>
               <p>DYing Work, my Beloved, is great Work, and a dying hour is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult hour; and therefore we had need have all things well ordered, and ready in the Matters of our Souls, againſt that time, that Work, that hour comes, I will lay the weight of dying work, and the difficulty of a dying hour before you in four Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt Propoſition is this (That Death in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41049:10"/>it ſelf, and in its own nature (if we look no further) is a very terrible thing; and we had need have all things ſet right in our ſouls, all things in order, when we come to encounter with it: The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who lookt not beyond the natural notion of death, called it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible of all terrible things. And in <hi>Job.</hi> 18.14. the Holy Ghoſt himſelf calls it, <hi>The King of Terrors: His confidence</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a wicked man) <hi>ſhall bring him to the King of Terrors: i.e.</hi> to death, which is moſt formidable; indeed 'tis therefore called the King of Terrors, becauſe it is the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Terror, and Death muſt needs be terrible in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it deprives us of all our ſweet comforts and enjoyments here in this World, and puts an eternal period to our fruition of them; here we enjoy much good, many ſtreams which run pleaſantly on each hand of us (it may be) but when Death comes; that deprives us of all. <hi>Naked came I into the World, and naked ſhall I return,</hi> Job 1.21. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we ſhall carry nothing out,</hi> ſpeaking as to our outward comforts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41049:11"/>here, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to the ſame effect, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 49.17. ſpeaks of a rich man; <hi>He ſhall carry nothing away; His Glory</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> Death, as one obſerves, is the greateſt Leveller in the World; it levels Scepters and Plow-ſhares, it makes the Prince as poor as the Peaſant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it diſſolves the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Body: Death is indeed the rending of Body and Soul, (thoſe old and loving Companions) aſunder. Now all diſunions, (as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divine obſerves) are uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſome diſunions are terrible: And, as ſome diſunions are terrible, ſo thoſe are of all others moſt terrible, that do rend them from us, which are moſt dear to us: Now what Union ſo near; as that between the ſoul and body? and therefore what diſunion ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the diſſolution of this Union? The diſſolving the Union between a man and his Wife is terrible; becauſe they are nearly united each to other: but the diſſolving the Union between Soul and Body, is more terrible, becauſe the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more near and cloſe. A man and his Wife <hi>are one fleſh;</hi> but the Soul and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41049:11"/>Body make but one Perſon: now Death diſſolves this Union: while we live the Soul dwels in the Body, informs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, acts in and by the Body; it hath a great influence upon, and is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Body: But when Death comes, then the Soul and Body part, till the Reſurrection; <hi>one returning to the duſt, whence it came, the other to God, who gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the deſtroying and demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of man, that famous and curious Fabrick, and a bringing it into duſt and putrefaction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.3. It turns a living body into a dead carcaſs, a lifeleſs lump of clay, and cauſeth it to become meat for Worms to feed on, <hi>Job</hi> 19.26. The body of man is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curious piece of Workmanſhip, ſuch as wherein the infinite power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is much ſeen and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.14, 15. But when Death comes, it marrs and demoliſhes all, ſtains all its beauty, and draws a Veil upon all its Glory. Sickneſs often makes a man's beauty to <hi>conſume away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a Moth,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.11. But Death utterly defaces it, and draws a Veil upon it; that turns his beauty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41049:12"/>blackneſs and deformity. One of the Ancients, ſtanding by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Tomb, wept, ſaying, where is now the beauty of <hi>Caeſar?</hi> What now is become of all his Magnificence? In a word, as life is the ſweeteſt of all outward mercies, ſo death is the ſharpeſt of all outward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: The pains of it are pains to a Proverb: the ſorrows of it are ſorrows to a Proverb: <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſs me about,</hi> Pſal. 116.3. Now if Death be thus terrible in it ſelf; then judge ye whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we had not need to have all things ready, and in order when it comes.</p>
               <p>Second Propoſition is; That in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour the Devil is moſt fierce and terrible in his aſſaults and temptations upon the Soul. The Devil is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called a <hi>Roaring Lyon:</hi> And is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moſt ſo againſt the poor people of God, when they come to die: <hi>then he hath wrath, becauſe he knows his time is ſhort:</hi> to allude to that <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. when a man or woman comes to die, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knows he hath but a ſhort time to tempt, to vex, to terrifie that Soul in; and therefore then uſually he exerciſes great wrath; then he ſtirs up all his wrath, all his malice, all his cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41049:12"/>him; hee ſees this is the laſt caſt he is like to have for it, the laſt on-ſet he is ever like to make upon the Souls Faith and Comfort, and that now the battle is to be won or loſt for ever; therefore now he roars and rages terribly indeed, now he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges all his Murdering Pieces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul, to make batteries, if poſſible, upon the Souls Fort of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſhake its foundation of life and happineſs. The Devil is the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Souls, <hi>Mal.</hi> 13.25. and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity works eſpecially one of theſe two ways: Either firſt to keep them from life and happineſs; and here he acts rather like an Angel of Light, than a Roaring Lyon: he works rather in a way of Flattery, than in a way of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Hence we read of his <hi>Wiles, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, Devices,</hi> and the like; his cunning and fallacious workings, thereby to deſtroy Souls. Or, ſecondly, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and torment Souls in their way to life and happineſs; and here he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed like a Roaring Lyon, and never more, than when we come to die. There are among others two ſeaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Devil is moſt fierce and terrible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41049:13"/>in his aſſaults upon the Soul. The firſt is, when a man is going from Sin to Grace, when he is fully reſolved to cloſe with Chriſt, to ſhake off the yoke of ſin, and to take upon him the yoke of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The ſecond is; when a man is going from Grace to Glory: when he is going off the Stage of Time to Eternity: when a man begins to live the ſpiritual life, and when a man comes to dye the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death. I know, firſt, That as for his own children, he uſually lets them alone, when they come to die: he is afraid to have them diſturbed; though ſometimes he cannot forbear, but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them before their time. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God can, and ſometimes does chain him up, ſo that he ſhall not be able to trouble and torment the Saints in their paſſage out of this World: yet ſtill I ſay, for the moſt part he does fiercely aſſault them then; and doubtleſs, there are but very few of the Children of God, but do meet with very ſore aſſaults from Sathan, when they come to die; then he turns Accuſer; then he charges the ſoul with all its ſins; then he tells him, he is an hypocrite, that all his profeſſion hath been nothing but a deluſion, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41049:13"/>the like: Now is Sathan thus fierce and terrible in his aſſaults upon the ſoul in a dying hour? ſurely then we had need have all ready againſt that hour comes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Propoſition is this; that in a dying hour Conſcience is moſt awakened; and ſo moſt quick and ſmart in its threats and charges againſt the Soul, if all be not right within; and therefore we had need have all ſo, in that hour. There are three ſeaſons in which Conſcience is moſt awake in the ſoul. Firſt, when God begins to deal with the ſoul in order to life and ſalvation; then God lets Conſcience looſe upon a man. Hence we read of them, that they <hi>were pricked at their heart,</hi> In the ſenſe of ſin, the word is, they were pricked through and through, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. And ſaith <hi>Paul, when Sin revived, I died, Rom.</hi> 7.9. That is, in the fight of my ſin, which was wrought in me by the Law of God, I was made to ſee my ſelf loſt and miſerable, and awakened out of my ſecurity. Secondly, when the ſoul is under ſome ſmart and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affliction from the hand of God: This is evident in that inſtance of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren, whoſe conſciences were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41049:14"/>awakened, when they were in diſtreſs, and charged them with the guilt of their ſin in ſelling their Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. Thirdly, when a man comes to die, when the viſions of death and the grave are before him: Oh you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle think, how ſtrict Conſcience will be in its ſearch, how ſharpe in its charge, and how ſevere in its cenſure in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour: then if there be but the leaſt frown in God's face towards the Soul, the leaſt flaw in his peace, the leaſt blot or blur in his Evidences for Heaven; if there be but the leaſt ſtain upon the Spirit, the leaſt ſin unpardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, it is a thouſand to one but conſcience will take notice of it, and charge the Soul with it. O Sirs, you will find a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Conſcience upon a bed of eaſe, and Conſcience upon a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; between Conſcience in an hour of health and worldly proſperity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in a dying hour: in the one, great things bear but little weight; but in the other, little things uſually bear great weight in Conſcience: then the Language of Conſcience to the Soul is, theſe and theſe things haſt thou done;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41049:14"/>thus and thus things ſtand with thee; at beſt, grace is thus and thus weak, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions thus and thus ſtrong, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thus and thus prevalent, the heart thus and thus out of frame, the ſpirit thus and thus alienated from God, and the like: Hence 'tis that at death there are ſuch confeſſions, as you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from men and women, that now they will ſend for ſome godly Miniſter or Chriſtian to pray with them, and for them; though perhaps they could not endure Prayer all their life-time before. Now if in a dying hour, Conſcience be thus quick and ſmart in its threats and charges againſt the Soul; then ſurely we had need, and 'tis greatly our concern, to have all ready, all in order, againſt that hour comes.</p>
               <p>The fourth Propoſition is this, That in a dying hour we ſhall have to do with God in a very ſtupendious and amazing way, in ſuch a way as may well ſtartle and affright us to think of it: we are ſaid <hi>to have to do with God</hi> here, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. we have here to do with God in Duties, in Ordinances, in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in Afflictions: indeed we had as good never have to do with theſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41049:15"/>we have to do with God in theſe: but though we have to do with God here, while we live; yet know, we ſhall have to do with God in another-gueſs way, when we come to die; in ſuch a way as may well overwhelm us to think of it. I ſhall give it you in three ſteps: then we have to do with God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; with God immediately, as our Judge; with God immediately, as our Judge for Eternity: And O how loud do theſe things call upon us to get all in order in the matters of our foul, againſt a dying hour comes?</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a man comes to die, he has to do with God immediately; and that is an aſtoniſhing thing. In death the body crumbles to duſt; but <hi>the ſoul returneth to God, that gave it:</hi> ſo the Holy Ghoſt-tells us, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. The body, which came from the duſt, crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to duſt again: but the ſoul, that goeth into God's immediate preſence, to deal and to treat with him, as it were face to face: The ſoul is alwayes with God, and cannot poſſibly be out of his preſence, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.7. And yet here the Holy Ghoſt tells us, when we die, the ſoul returns to God; intimating,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41049:15"/>that then the Soul goes into the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence of God, and has more immediately to do with him, then here he was ever wont to have; then he beholds his naked Majeſty and Glory: Now what an aſtoniſhing thing is this? You will find (if you obſerve) that the Saints of God, yea the holieſt of them, when they have dealt with God in a more immediate way than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, they have been overwhelmed by it: Take for an inſtance <hi>Daniel,</hi> who, upon receiving Viſions from God, tells us, <hi>there remained no ſtrength in him: That his comlineſs was turned into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Dan.</hi> 10.8. I might inſtance alſo in <hi>John,</hi> who upon a view of, and converſe with Chriſt, that was a little more immediate than ordinary, <hi>fell down at his feet, as dead, Revel.</hi> 1.17. Alſo that of <hi>Jacob, I have ſeen the Lord face to face, and yet my life is preſerved,</hi> (ſayes he) intimating, it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he could ſo immediately ſee God, and live, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. Now if we are to deal with God immediately, when we come to die, we had need have all in order, before a dying hour comes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41049:16"/>
2. When a man comes to die, he has to do with God immediately, as his Judge; as one that is to try him for his life; to paſs ſentence upon his Soul; to determine his ſtate in righteouſneſs, meaſuring out life, or death, happineſs, or vengeance to him in the other world: And is not this an aſtoniſhing and an amazing thing? Then (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking of death) <hi>ſhall the duſt return to earth, as it was, and the ſpirit return to God, who gave it, Eccl.</hi> 12.7. At death the Spirit returns to God; but it is to God, as a Judge, to determine his future condition for him. <hi>We muſt all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, and every one muſt give an account of himſelf to God:</hi> ſo the Scripture tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. And, <hi>it is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heb.</hi> 9.27. When a man comes to die, that which is immediately before him, is the Judgement of God; the ſtrict, the righteous, the impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: then away goes the Soul into the immediate preſence of God, as ſitting upon a Throne of Judgment, to paſs a ſentence of life, or death, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or damnation, upon him: And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41049:16"/>(believe it) we had need have all things ſet right, and well ordered in our ſouls, when we come thus to deal with him: we had need have all things well ordered, and ſet right in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our ſouls, when we come to deal with God, but as ſitting upon a Throne of Grace: but much more, when we come to deal with him, as ſitting upon a Throne of Judgment, to conclude and determine our future condition, what it ſhall be. Judgment is an aſtoniſhing and terrifying thing; <hi>the hearing of it made</hi> Felix <hi>tremble:</hi> or (as the Word is) it turned him into terror or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. And the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>the terror of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Now when a man comes to die, then he ſayes, or may ſay; Now I am to deal with the great God, the Judge of all: Now I muſt appear before his righteous Tribunal, and have the ſtate of my ſoul determined for life, or death, ſalvation, or damnation in the other World. O how great a thing is this!</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a man comes to die, he has to do with God immediately, as his Judge, for Eternity: and this ſpeaks it yet more terrifying and aſtoniſhing:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41049:17"/>For though a man is then to deal with God immediately, and that as his Judge too; yet if it were but for a time, for ſome ſhort term of years, it would not be altogether ſuch a terrifying and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing thing: but alas! it is for Eternity; and therefore his Judgment is called <hi>Eternal Judgment, Heb.</hi> 6.2. Hence <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of Death, calls it <hi>Oſtium Aeternitatis,</hi> the Gate of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: <hi>i. e.</hi> the Gate or Door that lets men out into Eternity; an Eternity of life, or death, ſalvation, or damnation: the ſentence which God will then paſs upon the ſoul, will be an eternal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and the ſoul muſt be eternally under the execution of it, whether it be for life, or death, ſalvation, or damnation. When a man comes to die, hee then ſees himſelf launching forth into the great Ocean of Eternity; he ſees his eternal all to be immediately at ſtake, and his eternal ſtate to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately determined by the great and holy God: now he ſees he muſt ſhoot the Great Gulf, and take up his abode in the Eternal Region: This fills him with amazement. O now, ſayes he, a ſentence muſt paſs upon me once for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41049:17"/>all; now I muſt ſhoot the Great Gulf; now I muſt launch forth into the great Ocean, where neither bounds, nor bottom is to be found for ever: now I muſt enter upon Eternal Joys, or Eternal Flames; an endleſs life, either with God or Devils, in Heaven or Hell: Now I ſhall ſind Infiniteneſs and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity combine to do their utmoſt, to make me happy or miſerable for ever: Now I muſt become the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject either of infinite wrath, or infinite love, infinite hatred, or infinite delight, and that for ever. Now I muſt hear from God, either <hi>come thou bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>depart thou curſed,</hi> and that for ever: And O what an aſtoniſhing thing is this! O Eternity, Eternity! O vaſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity! O Eternity, Eternity! O bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Eternity! One ſerious view of it is enough to amaze a poor ſoul, looking upon it at a diſtance: But how much more amazing muſt it needs be, when it ſhall be immediately before the ſoul, and he ſees he muſt enter upon it the next hour? O then it will be amazing indeed, aſtoniſhing indeed: This one thing, Eternity, puts infinite ſweetneſs into mercies, and infinite bitterneſs into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41049:18"/>ſufferings: the thoughts of this, was that which did ſo much amaze that good man, who ſitting in a deep Muſe a long time, and being asked the reaſon of it, was ſilent; and being asked again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, at length broke into theſe Words; <hi>For ever, for ever, for ever, for ever,</hi> and for near a quarter of an hour together ſpake nothing elſe: thereby telling them that asked him, that it was the thoughts of this ſame for ever, that ſo much amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him: And if you were more in the thoughts of the weight of Eternity, you would ſee it were an aſtoniſhing thing indeed: And this is that which makes dying work ſuch a weighty work and a dying hour ſuch a difficult hour. I will cloſe this head, and with that, this demonſtration, with a ſaying I have read in one of the Ancients; <hi>That is not to be accounted</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>an evil death, which has had a good life precede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, nor doth any thing make death terrible, but that which follows death; therefore they which muſt neceſſarily die, are not much to concern themſelves, what falls out to cauſe death, but whither by death they are conſtrained to go, whither death carries them.</hi> It is a great ſaying,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41049:18"/>and indeed 'tis no great matter, when we die, or how we die, or what is the occaſion of our death: But it is whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death carries us, and where death ſets us down; whether in a bleſſed, or wretched Eternity; whether with God, or Devils; in Heaven, or Hell. Well then, if Death be thus terrible in its own nature: If in a dying hour the Devil be ſo fierce and terrible in his aſſaults upon ſouls; if Conſcience be ſo awakened and ſmart in its Charges and Accuſations; if then we muſt have to do with God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and as our Judge, yea as our Judge for Eternity, as one that will determine the eternal condition of our ſouls, in unſpeakable happineſs, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable miſery; then ſurely dying work is great work, and a dying hour is a difficult hour: It then greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to have all ready, and all in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the matters of our ſouls, againſt the time thereof comes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Which ſhews the Glory, Sweetneſs, and Bleſſedneſs of the attainment of having all things ſet right in the matters of our Souls, before a dying hour comes, which will further evince the truth aſſerted.</head>
               <p>AS dying work is weighty work, and a dying hour is a difficult hour; ſo to have all things ſet right, all well ordered and compoſed, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our ſouls, againſt ſuch an hour comes, is an high, a ſweet, a bleſſed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, an attainment which carries infinite ſweetneſs and deſirableneſs in it: a taſte of which I ſhall give you in two things only. (1.) Hereby we come to be glorious Conquerours over Death and the Grave. (2.) Hereby we come to have an abundant entrance miniſtred to us into Heaven and Glory: And, my Beloved, what more ſweet and deſirable than this? Surely this ſpeaks it to be a very ſweet and bleſſed attainment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby we come to be glorious Conquerours over Death and the Grave. Death is an Enemy, 'tis the laſt enemy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41049:19"/>the Children of God have to grapple and conflict with: <hi>The laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed is Death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.26. and being the laſt enemy, in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they conquer all, conquering this they are compleat and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours: Now, by having all things ſet right in the matters of our ſouls, all things ready, and in order for a dying hour, we come to conquer this laſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yea, to get a glorious Conqueſt over it: Hereby <hi>Death comes to be ſwallowed up of Victory,</hi> as you have the expreſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. Hereby <hi>we are more than Conquerours over it,</hi> Rom. 8.37. Take the Conqueſt which this gives us over Death, in theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Hereby the ſoul is carried above the fear of Death: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. We read of ſome, <hi>who all their life-time were ſubject to bondage through fear of Death:</hi> And, if in their life-time, much more when they come to a dying hour: Then Conſcience (as you have heard) is more awake: Oh the fears, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the Hell upon Earth, that the ſight of Death's approach fills many a poor ſoul withall! But now take a ſoul that has all things right, and in order in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41049:20"/>ſpiritual concerns, and he is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fear of this King of Terrours; and that when made as terrible; as the wit and malice of men can poſſibly make it: He can converſe with his laſt enemy as one that hath loſt his ſting and power, and ſo without the leaſt fear or diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of ſpirit: <hi>None of theſe things move me,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, that I may finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> His Afflictions did not move him, did not terrifie him; but if death ſhould come, what then? Why that ſhall be welcom too, ſaith he, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. Who is afraid of a conquered enemy, an enemy which a man ſeeth dead and ſlain in the field? One that has all things ready for a dying hour, he ſees death to be a conquered enemy, an enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the death of Chriſt; and ſo is carried above the fear of it.</item>
                  <item>2. Hereby the ſoul is inabled in a holy manner to triumph over death, and even to ſcorn and contemn it; which is an higher Conqueſt ſtill. A man that has all things ſet right, and well ordered in the matters of his ſoul, he is not only carried above the fear of death; but he rides in triumph
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41049:20"/>over it, as one that divideth the ſpoil: He can with boldneſs and comfort challenge this laſt Enemy of his, and even dare it to do its worſt to him: <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: But thanks be to God, who giveth us the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. As if he ſhould ſay, Death, you talk of a Sting; but where is it? Grave, you would threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us with Victory and overthrow; but do your worſt, conquer us if you can. As a man that has diſarmed his Enemy, thrown him upon his back, ſayes to him; O Sir, where is your Sword? Where is your Piſtol? Where is the execution you threatned? Do your worſt?</item>
                  <item>3. Hereby the Soul comes to be able, ſolemnly to chooſe and deſire Death; yea to exult, and rejoyce in Death; as that which of an Enemy is become a Friend, and an in-let into all happineſs to him. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 6, 8. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing, is God, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41049:21"/>ſo given unto us the earneſt of his Spirit: Therefore we are alwayes confident, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whileſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: We are confident, I ſay, and willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> So Phil. 1.22, 23. <hi>But if I live in the fleſh, this is the fruit of my Labour; yet what I ſhall chooſe, I wot not; for I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> Mark, he deſires Death, he chooſes Death, as that which is a Friend to him, and an in-let into his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Such an one can ſay, as I have read a <hi>German</hi> Divine did, when dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>I am ready</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and deſire to be gone out of this life, in which all things are not only full of miſeries and calamities; but which is to be lamented, all things are full fraught with ſins: I ſay; I deſire to paſs into that life in which there is no ſin, no miſery.</hi> Yea, more, ſuch an one can exult, and rejoyce in death, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29, 30. <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace according to thy word; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41049:21"/>They are words of joy and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the ſight of Death's approach. The Child of ſome tender and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Father, being abroad at ſojourn, and ſeeing a Meſſenger come from his Father, to fetch him home; how does he exult and rejoyce? O (ſayes he) my Father has ſent for me home; now I muſt go to live with my Father, to eat and drink at my Father's Table, to live in my Father's preſence, enjoy my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's love and counſels: and this he rejoyces in, and exultingly embraces the Meſſenger. 'Tis the very caſe here, the ſoul having all things ready, all things ſet right within, when Death comes, 'tis but as a Meſſenger to him, to fetch him home to his Father's houſe, which he can welcome and embrace with joy. O (ſayes he) my Father has ſent for me home, home to Heaven, there to live immediately in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and upon his fulneſs; and now I ſhall be for ever with my Father; now I ſhall for ever feaſt my Soul with my Father's love, and the conſtant views of my Father's face: now I ſhall <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> whom here I could never <hi>ſee, but through a glaſs darkly:</hi> now I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41049:22"/>ſhall ſee, and be for ever in the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my ſweet Lord; my Lord that bled for me, that died for, that <hi>trod the Wine-preſs alone</hi> for me: Now ſhall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>the glorious liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God:</hi> I have hitherto been in bondage, in bondage to Satan, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to my own heart, which has all along wretchedly impoſed upon me; but now I ſhall enter upon the glorious liberty of the Children of God: Now I ſhall <hi>partake of the Inheritance of the Saints in light:</hi> Now I ſhall bathe my ſoul in the Chryſtal ſtreams of undefiled pleaſures, running freſh along the banks of Eternity at my Father's right hand: Now I ſhall ſpend a whole Eternity in Praiſes, Doxologies, and Hallelujah's to God, and the Lamb: Now I ſhall have all my ſpots and wrinkles, my ſins and ſorrows done away at once: Now ſhall I ſigh no more, and which is infinitely better, I ſhall ſin no more for ever; no more complain of dark viſions, and ſhort viſits from God; no more complain of diſtances and alienation between him and my Soul for ever: There ſhall be no more interruption of communion with my ſweet Saviour; but I ſhall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41049:22"/>ſtand in his preſence, and behold his face for evermore. In a word, hereby death, the King of Terrors, becomes the King of Comforts to the Soul; and a man comes to die both happily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. Some men die neither happily nor comfortably; and ſuch is the caſe of all, who die out of Chriſt; they die in their ſins, they die to be damned for ever. Some die happily, but not comfortably; ſuch is the caſe of poor Chriſtians dying under diſſertion, whoſe Sun ſets in a Cloud; they die in the dark, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhall become of their Souls to Eternity, which yet go ſafe to Heaven being built upon the Rock of Ages, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Some die both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and comfortably; ſuch is the caſe of all thoſe who have all things ſet right (between God and them) all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in order; before a dying hour comes. Some die preſumptuouſly, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all is right and well in the matters of their ſouls, when indeed nothing is ſo, that is ſad for Eternity: The Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſouls and mine from ſuch an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.</hi> Some die tremblingly or doubtingly, not knowing how things are with them, whether well or ill, but they fear ill;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41049:23"/>that is ſad, at leaſt for time: the Lord carry us above ſuch an <hi>Exit.</hi> Some (<hi>viz.</hi> well ordered ſouls) die fiducially, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to be right between God and them; and that is comfortable both for time and eternity. Well then, if hereby we come to have ſuch a glorious Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over Death and the Grave, it muſt then be a great attainment to have all things in order between God and us; and conſequently greatly our concern to have things ſo.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby we come to have a rich and glorious entrance miniſtred to us into everlaſting life, and glory, into Heaven and bleſſedneſs. As hereby we come to be glorious Conquerours over the natural death; ſo hereby we come to have a rich and glorious entrance miniſtred to us into the eternal life, which alſo carries much ſweetneſs and bleſſedneſs in it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.11. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. that is, grow as compleat in Grace as poſſibly you can, make ſure of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, make all ready in the matters of your ſouls: and what then? <hi>So an entrance ſhall be miniſtred to you abundantly into the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41049:23"/>everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And is not this a bleſſed attainment? Take this in three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Hereby the ſoul comes to enjoy much of Heaven here upon earth; much of bleſſedneſs and glory, whileſt on this ſide bleſſedneſs and glory; then hath a man an abundant entrance miniſtred unto him into heaven and glory, when he hath much of heaven and glory given out to him here on earth, large earneſt, and firſt-fruits: and this the ſoul has that hath all things right in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his ſpiritual ſtate, all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and in order within. Hence we read ſometimes of <hi>the earneſt,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>the firſt-fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 1.14. Rom. 8.28. And the ſoul that is moſt ready, has the greateſt earneſt and firſt-fruits, that is to ſay, the greateſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Heaven, here upon earth: For that which makes us ready for a dying hour, is ſomething of heaven dropped into the ſoul here.</item>
                  <item>2. Hereby he comes to go triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly from Earth to Heaven; to go to Heaven and Glory with a Crown upon his head; and is not this a ſweet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Then hath a man an abundant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41049:24"/>entrance into Heaven and Glory, when he goes triumphingly thither: When a man paſſes to heaven and glory with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof in his eye, and prelibati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof in his ſoul; with a clear witneſs and evidence in his Spirit, that he is going to poſſeſs the fulneſs thereof, with God and Chriſt for ever: when a man enters into life without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes from God, or his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; without any ſtumbling through doubting or unbelief: This is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch, as have all things well in their ſouls, before a dying hour comes. It is with ſuch in death, as it was with <hi>John</hi> in a Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1. They, as it were, <hi>hear a voice from Heaven, ſaying, Come up hither; and immediately they are in the Spirit.</hi> Some poor ſouls croud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, through a throng of doubts and unbelief, difficulties and deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, through many fears and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; inſomuch that it might be truly ſaid of them, that they are <hi>ſearcely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> as the Apoſtle's expreſſion is; but others go through none of theſe, they go triumphantly with a Crown upon their Heads as it were. So <hi>Paul</hi> 2. Tim. 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>I am now ready to be offered,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41049:24"/>and the time of my departure is at hand: I have fought a good fight, I have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my courſe, I have kept the faith: Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, ſhall give me at that day; and not unto me only, but to all them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that love his appearing.</hi> Methinks I ſee how this holy ſoul went triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to the Throne of God, and the Lamb. When <hi>David and the houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>brought up the Arke of the Lord, it was with ſhouting, and with the ſound of the Trumpet:</hi> So when ſuch a ſoul goes to reſt, 'tis with a kind of ſhouting and triumph, among the Saints themſelves, who all reach the ſame heaven and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at laſt. There is a very great deal of difference in their death, and in their going to that heaven and glory. As (you know) two Ships may arrive at the ſame Harbour, yet with much difference, as to the manner of their coming in: The one makes a ſhift to get in; but 'tis with her Anchors loſt, her Sails rent, her Flags down, her Maſts broken, and the like: but the other comes in brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, riding, as 'twere, in triumph, with her Sails ſpread, her Anchors ſafe, her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41049:25"/>flags flying, her Trumpets ſounding, and her Mariners ſhouting. So great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is in the paſſing of Saints to Heaven and Bleſſedneſs: Now what an attainment muſt it be to go with ſhouting and triumph?</item>
                  <item>3. Hereby the ſoul comes to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, and inveſted with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fulneſs of Bleſſedneſs and Glory with God for ever: Then has a man an abundant entrance into heaven and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when he is admitted to, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with an eminent fulneſs of glory and bleſſedneſs in heaven for ever; and this he hath, who has all right and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the concerns of his ſoul, when he comes to die: Such a one receives a full reward, as the expreſſion is 2 <hi>Epiſtle of John</hi> 8. and <hi>has much fruit abounding to his account,</hi> Phil. 4.7. And O what a ſweet and bleſſed attainment does this ſpeak it to be, to have all in order againſt a dying hour comes? Now if it be ſuch an attainment to have things ſet right, and in order in our ſouls, againſt a dying hour, then ſurely it muſt needs be highly our concern to have all things ſo.</item>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Which ſhews the ſtate of men and women under death, as a further evidence of our aſſertion.</head>
               <p>AS to have all things ready, and in order, when a dying hour comes, is an high and glorious attainment; ſo ſuch is the ſtate and condition of men and women under death, that it cannot but be highly their concern to have all things ſet right, all things ready in the matters of their ſouls, when they come to die: This I will ſet before you in three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt Propoſition is this; <hi>That ſuch is the ſtate and condition of men and women under death, that there is no return for them into this life any more for ever.</hi> When once a man's Sun is ſet, it never riſes more: when once a man has his <hi>Exit,</hi> is gone off the ſtage of this world, he never enters more; there is no more any part to be acted here by him, this you have in the Text: <hi>Before I go hence, and be no more;</hi> that is, no more in this World.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41049:26"/>So <hi>Job</hi> 7.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>O remember, that my life is wind, mine eyes ſhall no more ſee good: The eye of him that hath ſeen me, ſhall ſee me no more: Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not: As the Cloud is conſumed and vaniſheth away; ſo he that goeth down to the Grave, ſhall come up no more. He ſhall return no more to his Houſe, and his place ſhall know him no more.</hi> Again, <hi>Job</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>Are not my dayes few? Ceaſe then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little; before I go, whence I ſhall not return, even into the Land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſhadow of death.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Ch.</hi> 16.22. <hi>When a few dayes are come, then ſhall I go the way, whence I ſhall not return.</hi> All ſhewing, that when a man is once gone off the Stage of this World, there is no return for him any more.</p>
               <p>Second Propoſition is this; <hi>That ſuch is the ſtate of men and women under death, that there is nothing to be done for their ſouls; there is nothing to be mended that is amiſs, nothing to be ſet in order, that ſhall be found out of order.</hi> Death (my beloved) is not the time of working, but of receiving the reward of our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41049:26"/>work: Death leaves us under an utter and eternal impoſſibility of ever doing any thing for another World: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>whatever thine hand findeth to do</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>do it with al thy might; for there is no work, nor counſel in the Grave, whither thou goeſt,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.10. And <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day; becauſe the night cometh, when no man can work, ſaith Chriſt,</hi> John 9.4. Death is a ſtate of darkneſs, and it deprives us of all helps, advantages, and opportunities, of ever doing any thing for the good of our ſouls: There is no repenting, no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, no turning to God in the Grave: There is no aſſuring pardon of ſin; no getting an Intereſt in Chriſt; no making our Calling and Election ſure there: O no; theſe things muſt be done now, or they can never be done; and if they be never done, our ſouls are for ever undone. 'Twas an Epicurean ſaying of him, who ſaid, <hi>Eat, drink, play; for after death there is no pleaſure:</hi> but it would be a Chriſtian ſaying, to ſay to you, and my own ſoul, love God, pray to him, ſeek his face, repent, believe, make ſure of Chriſt;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41049:27"/>for after death none of theſe are to be done: They muſt be done here, or never.</p>
               <p>Third Propoſition is this, <hi>That ſuch is the ſtate of men and women under death, that the Soul is actually and irreverſibly ſtated and concluded in his eternal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Souls eternal ſtate is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fix'd, and unchangeably determined, without any alteration for ever.</hi> 'Tis an obſervation among the School-men, that look what befel the Angels that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that in death befalls wicked men, thoſe that are not ready for a dying hour: The Angels immediately upon their ſinning, were ſtated in an irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible condition of wo and miſery: And wicked men, unready ſouls, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon death, are irreverſibly ſtated in a like eternal condition; they are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſealed up under damnation: And the Devils may as ſoon get out of thoſe Chains of eternal darkneſs, whereinto they are caſt, and in which they are locked up, being reſerved unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as ſuch perſons can change, or reverſe that condition. The truth is, death; when ever, ot where ever it comes, is a determining thing, it concludes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41049:27"/>the ſoul for ever under an unalterable ſtate of life or death, of happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; for <hi>as the Tree falls, ſo it lies,</hi> Eccl. 11.3. Hence in death, <hi>the Spirit,</hi> the ſoul is ſaid, <hi>to return to God,</hi> Eccl. 12.7. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a learned man has this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receives the Soul of Man, when he dies, to himſelf; and having received it, he delivers it either to the Holy Angels, that by them it might be carried to Heaven, if it hath been holy and good; or he delivers it to the evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, by them to be dragged into Hell, if it hath been ungodly.</hi> Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>after death comes judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. By which is meant the particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every man and woman imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon death; which is nothing elſe but the ſtating of the ſoul in an eternal condition. Hence alſo, when <hi>Dives</hi> is brought in, deſiring that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> might <hi>dip the tip of his finger in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool his tongue:</hi> anſwer is made, that it cannot be, for as much as there is no going for any, either from Hell to Heaven, or from Heaven to Hell, becauſe <hi>there is a Gulph fixed,</hi> Luke 16.26. Noting the unalterableneſs of that ſtate which Death ſets men down in,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41049:28"/>whether of happineſs or miſery. Well then, if ſuch be the ſtate of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under death, as we have heard, then ſurely 'tis highly our concernment to have all ready, all in order, againſt a dying hour comes. Having given you thus briefly the demonſtration of the point, I ſhall make ſome practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it.</p>

                  </gap> wonderfully to ſpare them for dayes, for weeks, for months, for years together
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41049:28"/>and that for this very end, that they ſhould make themſelves ready, and ſet all right in the matters of their ſouls, againſt a dying hour comes: but woe, and alas for them! This they mind not, this they concern not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about, but do live in a total neglect thereof; than which what greater folly can they be guilty of? Pray mind what God himſelf ſpeaks in this caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.28, 29. Where he ſaith concerning <hi>Iſrael, they were a Nation void of counſel, nor was there any underſtanding in them:</hi> And what then? <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this; that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> Obſerve here two things atteſted and verified by God himſelf. (Firſt) that 'tis a point of the higheſt wiſdom the Sons of men are capable of, ſeriouſly to conſider their latter end, that is, to prepare for death, to ſet all things right in the matters of their ſouls, ſo as that things may iſſue well with them at laſt, and they may go off the Stage of this World with comfort. (Secondly) that not to do this, is a point of the greateſt folly? It doth evidently argue men to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41049:29"/>be void of counſel, and all true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: It would have been their wiſdom to have conſidered their latter end; and their not doing of it, argued them to be guilty of notorious folly: Theſe things, you may ſee, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf atteſts and verifies here. And, my Beloved, what greater folly can there be, than for a man to live in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that which is of ſo much weight and importance for him to mind, as this is? Surely the greater the concern is, the greater muſt our folly be in the neglect thereof: yet this is the folly that the moſt of men are guilty of; they mind not their latter end, their dying hour; at leaſt not ſo, as to make a timely proviſion for it: God lets them live many years, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they rejoyce in them all; but they forget the dayes of darkneſs, which are many: They regard not the ſtate of their ſouls, nor how things ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, in reference to another World: And O that this were not the folly of too many of us, who profeſs the belief of another life, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate: <hi>We live and enjoy good, but we put far from us the evil day,</hi> as thoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41049:29"/>are ſaid to do <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3. God ſpares us time after time; but no proviſion do we make for a dying hour. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us have never yet ſet any thing right in the matters of our ſouls, any thing in order, againſt the time comes, when we are to go hence, and be no more; that have ſcarce ever had yet one ſerious thought of Death, Judgment, or Eternity, nor made the leaſt tittle of proviſion for them? And what ſhall I ſay to ſuch? I would (if God ſaw good) awaken them out of their folly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of it: In order to which, I would plead a little with them in five or ſix particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Muſt we not all go hence? <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, <hi>there is a time to be born, and a time to die,</hi> Eccl. 3.2. And the one is as ſure as the other; as ſure as we have had a time to be born, ſo ſure we ſhall have a time to die; and the living know it: <hi>The living know, that they ſhall die,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.5. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they may well know it: for not only the experience of between five and ſix thouſand years tells them ſo; but it is what is <hi>appointed,</hi> what is infallibly determined by the unchangeable Law,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41049:30"/>and Degree of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. nor can any thing whatever exempt us from the ſtroak of Death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Youthful ſtrength and vigour can't do it: For young men die, as well as old; ſtrong men die, as well as weak. <hi>One dieth in his full ſtrength,</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>being wholly at eaſe and quiet; his breaſts are full of milk, and his bones are moiſtned with marrow,</hi> Job 21.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Worldly pomp and greatneſs can't do it: For great men die, as well as mean men; rich men die, as well as poor men. <hi>Where is the Houſe of the Prince?</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) Anſwer is made, <hi>He ſhall be brought to the Grave, and ſhall remain in the Tomb, the clods of the Valley ſhall be ſweet unto him, and every man ſhall draw after him, as there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable before him,</hi> Job 21.28, 32, 33. So in the 49 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Be not thou afraid, when one is made rìch, when the Glory of his Houſe is increaſed: For when he dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away, his glory ſhall not deſcend after him; though while he lived, he bleſſed his ſoul,</hi> and the like; <hi>he ſhall go to the generation of his Fathers, he ſhall never ſee light.</hi>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41049:30"/>
3. Humane wiſdom and policy can't do it; for wiſe men die, as well as fools. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Wiſe men die, likewiſe the Fool;</hi> yea, in many reſpects, <hi>Wiſe men die as the Fool,</hi> Eccl. 2.16. Pray, what is become of all the wiſe men, and great Politicians that have lived in former Ages? Truly the clods of the Valley cover them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Spiritual gifts and graces can't do it: For good men die, as well as bad; holy men, as well as wicked men: <hi>The righteous man periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away,</hi> Iſa. 57.1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Eminency of place and ſervice can't do it. <hi>Your Fathers, where are they? And the Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> Zach. 1.5. What higher place, than to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to be an Ambaſſadour for God? and yet ſuch die. Nothing (you ſee) can exempt us from death's ſtrokes: Why then ſhould we neglect to prepare for it? I will cloſe this Head with a ſaying I have read in one of the Ancients; <hi>What among humane affairs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is more certain than death? What more uncertain than the hour of death? Death compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates not poverty; it reverences not either the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41049:31"/>greatneſs, it ſpares no Sex, no Manners, no Age; only it ſeems to come in at the gate upon old men; but craftily it ſteals in upon young ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Does not death haſten upon us all? As we muſt all die, ſo death haſtens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace upon us: Every ſtep we take is a ſtep towards death and the grave: So we find, Eccl. 9.10. <hi>Our whole life is</hi> (as one well obſerves upon that place) <hi>nothing elſe, but a journey towards Death and the Grave;</hi> whether we ſleep or wake, eat or drink, trade or travel, pray or play, we are ſtill haſtening to the Grave: A dying hour haſtens upon us all; and how faſt (pray) does it haſten upon us? Faſter than a Weavers Shuttle does to the end of the Web: <hi>My dayes</hi> (ſaith Job) <hi>are ſwifter than a Weavers Shuttle, Job</hi> 7.6. How faſt does it haſten upon us? As faſt as, yea faſter than a Poſt haſtens to the end of his Stage, or a ſwift Ship to the Harbour, under the advantage of Wind and Tide, or the ſwift flying Eagle to the prey. <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>they flee away, they ſee no good: They are paſſed away, as the ſwift Ships; as the Eagle haſteneth to the prey,</hi> Job 9.25, 26.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41049:31"/>How faſt does it haſten upon us? So faſt, as that for ought we know, it will be upon us, before we ſee the light of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee,</hi> Luke 10.20. How faſt does it haſten upon us? So faſt, as that for ought we know, it may be upon us the next hour, yea the next moment: <hi>They ſpend their dayes in mirth, and in a moment go down to the grave, Job</hi> 21.13. To be ſure it will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us ſpeedily, and it may be upon us ſuddenly. I pray, conſider, what are we? And what is our life? Wind: <hi>Job</hi> 7.7. <hi>O remember, that my life is wind,</hi> an hands breadth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.5. <hi>Behold thou haſt made my dayes as an hands-breadth; mine Age is as nothing before thee:</hi> a declining ſhadow, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102.11. <hi>My dayes are like a ſhadow that declineth, and I am withered like Graſs:</hi> A Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Field which is withered, and gone with the Wind: <hi>As for man, his dayes are as Graſs, as a Flower of the Field, the Wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof knoweth it no more,</hi> Pſalm 103.15, 16. And again, <hi>All fleſh is Graſs, and the goodlineſs thereof as the Flower of the Field, the Graſs withereth, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41049:32"/>Flower fadeth; becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: Surely the people is graſs,</hi> Iſa. 40.6, 7. Vanity, and a ſhadow: <hi>Man is like to vanity, his dayes are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away,</hi> Pſalm 144.4. <hi>A vapour which appeareth for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is gone,</hi> James 4.14. O how ſoon may one, or another, or all of us, be among the dead? How ſoon may death approach us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What infinite mercy is it, that God has ſpared us thus long, and ſtill does ſpare us to ſet all things right, to make all ready for a dying hour? O (my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) how great is the ſparing mercy of God towards us? We have had ſome forty, ſome fifty, ſome ſixty years in the World; and ſtill God ſpares us; ſtill he lets us live, and enjoy good: and why all this? (think you) ſmely to ſet things right in our ſouls, to make ready for a dying hour, and ſhall we yet neglect it? God forbid. O Sirs, think a little, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, with your ſelves; how long ſince the Grave might have ſwallowed us up, and the Bottomleſs Pit have ſhut its mouth upon us: How long ſince might time and dayes have been at an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41049:32"/>end with us, and our ſouls ſtated in a miſerable Eternity? But ſtill God ſpares us, and we are yet in the Land of the Living, with a door of mercy and grace yet open unto us; at leaſt a poſſibility left us of knowing the things of our peace in our day, of making proviſion for Death and Eternity: And O what mercy is this! I would fain a little quicken both you and my ſelf by this conſideration: And in order thereunto, let me plead a little particularly with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how long God hath ſpared, and does ſpare you; beyond what he does, and has, thouſands and ten thouſands of others: God does not ſpare all at that rate, which he has ſpared, and does ſtill ſpare us: Alas! How many thouſands are there now free among the dead, who came into being long ſince we did? Their Glaſs is run, their Sun is ſet, their day is over, their hopes and expectations are all at an end, their ſouls, are ſtated in an eternal condition, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that will admit of neither change nor period for ever; and yet we are ſpared ſtill: They came into the World long after us, and are gone into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41049:33"/>long before us: Yea, how many are there, that never arrived to the one half of thoſe years that we have arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? their Sun has ſet in the morning: How many of us have out-lived our yoke-fellows, our children, our ſervants, our friends, and acquaintance? And yet we ſtand our ground: and all this that we might prepare for a dying hour: <hi>This patience of God ſhould lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Rom. 2.5. And O that it might ſo do!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how much we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, and what advantage we have given him in Juſtice againſt us: I would fay here, as Chriſt ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. begin. <hi>Suppoſe ye, that thoſe Galileans, whoſe blood</hi> Pilate <hi>mingled with their Sacrifices, were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh: Or thoſe eighteen upon whom the Tower of</hi> Siloah <hi>fell, and ſlew them; think ye, they were ſinners above all the men that dwelt in</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> So ſay I here, ſuppoſe ye, that thoſe that are gone down to the gates of the grave, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41049:33"/>the bars of death, before us, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſinners than we? I tell you nay, but except we repent, we muſt all likewiſe periſh: We have ſinned as well as they, and poſſibly, in many regards, more than they: To be ſure, we have all over and over deſerved long ſince to have been covered with the ſhadow of the Night of eternal darkneſs: O how has the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God been tried, and his long-ſufferings put to it by us! What a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den have we been to his Soul! Some of us have cauſe to think, that we have been as great a burden to God, as moſt that ever lived: How juſtly may the bleſſed God complain of many of us: <hi>That we have made him to ſerve with our ſins, and wearied him with our iniquities,</hi> as he did of them of old? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.24. that <hi>we have broke his heart with our whoriſh heart, whereby we have departed from him,</hi> Ezek. 6.9. that <hi>our ſins have preſſed him down, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves, Amos</hi> 2.13. Alas! Alas! How have we wallowed in our pollutions, and acted out the enmity and rebellion of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt him! How have we reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Word, reſiſted his Spirit, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Grace, trampled upon his Son,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41049:34"/>refuſed many and many an offer of love, and many a ſweet Call, and bleſſed invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to come to the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb? And yet that he ſhould ſtill ſpare us: O what mercy is this! In the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. we read, that <hi>the long-ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah:</hi> And truly, my Beloved, it waits as much in our dayes, our provocations being as many, and as high againſt him, as theirs of that Generation were. O Sirs, why are we not in Hell? Why are we not ſealed and ſhut up among the damned? Why have we one Call more, one offer more, one ſeaſon of Grace more? Verily 'tis all rich Mercy: O that it might lead us to Repentance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how ſad it had been with us; had the Lord taken that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us, which we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over given him. Suppoſe (my Beloved) God had not ſpared us, but had cut us off, as he might long ſince; what now had been become of us? And where now had we been? Had you died of ſuch and ſuch a ſickneſs you have been in, when poſſibly a ſentence of Death was paſſed upon you, both by your ſelves and others, and there was really but a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41049:34"/>ſtep between death and you; where and how miſerable had you now been? Had you not been now in the flames, eternally ſeparated from God and Chriſt? Being Godleſs and Chriſtleſs: Have you not now cauſe to fear you had been in as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable a condition, as the Devils themſelves are in, ſealed up under wrath and condemnation, paſt all hopes and poſſibility of mercy for ever? <hi>Whither had I gone</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>if then</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the time that he was in his ſins) <hi>I had gone hence? Whither had I gone, but into the flames, and into eternal torments, anſwerable to my ſins?</hi> May not we ſay the like? But bleſſed be God, it is yet time and ſeaſon with me and you; we are ſpared to this hour, that we might provide for death and Eternity. O Sirs, ſuppoſe you or I were now among the damned; ſuppoſe we were, as they are, ſealed up under wrath, and ſeparated from God, left under an utter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ever ſeeing his face; how ſad then would our condition be? Why, thus it might have been with us: O what mercy then is it that God has ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us, and doth-ſpare us as he does? And how ſhould it awaken us to our work?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41049:35"/>
4. Conſider, how much more ſad it may, and will yet be with us, in caſe we provide not for a dying hour: Truly, the longer God ſpares us, if we anſwer not his end in his ſparing mercy, the more miſerable ſhall we be for ever. It will be ſad to periſh at all; but it will be doubly ſad to periſh under the long-ſuffering of God, under the abuſe of much goodneſs, and long patience. O to have many dayes, and many years pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and goodneſs come in to witneſs againſt a man at laſt; how ſad will this be! Think of, and ſeriouſly lay to heart that Scripture, Rom. 2.4, 5. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? but after thy hardneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent heart, treaſureſt up to thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the righteous Judgment of God.</hi> Every day which God in his patience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us, if we be not led to repentance, is a day of treaſuring up wrath, heaping up to our ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, when wrath ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to the uttermoſt: Well, think then what a mercy it is, that God ſpares you
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41049:35"/>as he does; and what an Obligation this ſparing mercy of his is upon you, to ſet all things right in the matters of your ſouls againſt a dying hour comes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are you ſure that thoſe helps and advantages which now you enjoy, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you in your work, will alwayes laſt and be injoyed by you. Suppoſe (my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) that God ſhould yet ſpare you, and prolong your dayes in the Land of the Living: Yet O how ſoon may all your helps and advantages, to further you in this great Work, be withdrawn from you: Now, bleſſed be God, you injoy many bleſſed helps and advantages for your furtherance in this great Work; but how quickly may they all be gone?</p>
               <p n="1">1. How ſoon may the Reproofs, the Counſels, the Holy Examples of your godly Friends, Miniſters, and Relations, be withdrawn from you? now you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the loving Reproofs, the wholeſome Counſels, the Holy Examples of ſuch and ſuch Friends and Relations; one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves you for ſin, another quickens you to duty; one dehorts you from the World, and carnal pleaſure; another perſwades you to cloſe with Chriſt, and walk with God, to purſue after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41049:36"/>and eternal life; one wooes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches you, another charges and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to labour to know God, and to live to him, to provide for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; and they all ſhew you the path of Life; they tread the way to Heaven in your ſight: All which are great helps and advantages to further you in this Great Concern of yours: But how ſoon may all theſe be withdrawn? thy Friends, thy Miniſters, thy Relations will ſpeedily be lodged in the duſt, and thou ſhalt never have a word of reproof, a word of counſel, a word of quickning, a word of encouragement, or a pattern of faith and holineſs ſet before thee, by them any more for ever, which would be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing: Now thy godly Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Yoke-fellow, Maſter, Friend, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, is plying thee with counſels and inſtructions, for the good of thy Soul; to morrow, it may be, he or ſhe goes down to the Gates of the Grave; and then no more of this for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How ſoon may the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, which you now enjoy, be withdrawn from you? Now you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Word and Ordinances of God, you go from Ordinance to Ordinance;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41049:36"/>you have <hi>line upon line, precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.10. Yea, let me tell you, <hi>you ſee and hear thoſe things, which many Prophets and righteous men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee, and hear; but ſaw, and heard them not,</hi> Matth. 13.16. O how is <hi>Light and immortality brought to light</hi> to you? How is the Way of Salvation made plain and manifeſt before you? What glorious diſcoveries? What bleſſed reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? What ſweet and frequent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Chriſt are made to you? How freely are you <hi>called to the Marriage-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb?</hi> How lovingly does Chriſt invite you to himſelf? How kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does he ſtand knocking at the Door of your ſouls? O (my Beloved) I may now ſay to you, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Behold! Now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> O what helps and advantages are theſe? But how ſoon may they all be gone? How ſoon may the Word of God be withdrawn? How ſoon may your light be put out, and your ſouls left in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not knowing whither to go? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that word of Chriſt, and lay it to heart, John 12.35. <hi>Yet a little while is the light with you, walk while ye have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41049:37"/>the light; leaſt darkneſs come upon you; and he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the Children of the light.</hi> It is a great queſtion, whether we may not loſe Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances and all; and where are we then?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How ſoon may the motions and ſtrivings of the Spirit of God be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from you? Now you have the motions and ſtrivings of the Spirit of God in you, and with you; <hi>he moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the waters</hi> in your ſouls; he moves and ſtrives in and by the Word, and Ordinances; Mercies, and afflictions; now you have enlightening, and then you have quickening influences from him; now he ſhews you your work, and then he tenders you his aſſiſtance; now he diſcovers the odiouſneſs of ſin to you, and then he diſplays the beauty, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and excellency of Chriſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before you: But alas! How ſoon may all this be at an end? Think of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible word, Gen. 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive with man.</hi> God may poſſibly the next day, yea the next hour, ſay to his Spirit concerning one or another of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41049:37"/>us, let him alone, ſtrive no more with him, move no more in him, convince him no more, perſwade him no more, draw and allure him no more; he is addicted to his luſts, and to this World, let him alone; he has no mind to Heaven, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make any proviſion for another World, let them alone; he is unwilling to ſee beyond time to eternity; he is given to his carnal pleaſures, let him alone; he has a reſiſting, gain-ſaying ſpirit, let him alone. O how ſoon theſe, and all other helps and advantages, you now enjoy, may be withdrawn, who knows? You have all theſe together in one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which I deſire you to lay to heart, Luke 19.41, 42. <hi>When he was come near, he beheld the City</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>) <hi>and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> They had had a day, they did injoy the things of their peace; they might and ſhould have improved their day, and the things of their peace, by ſecuring their eternal ſtate: But they neglected it, and now all theſe are withdrawn from them; which cauſed the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

               <p n="5">5. Is it an eaſie matter (think you) to ſet things right in your ſouls and to make all things ready for a dying hour? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (my Beloved) that you ſhould live yet many days, and withall, your helps and advantages for the good of your ſouls ſhould be continued to you, yet is it an eaſie work which you have to do; and ſhall you have time and days to ſpare? Believe it, Sirs, all will be little enough to ſet things right, to make things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a dying hour. Pray conſider with me theſe few things, as to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider in what a woful diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things are at preſent with you, and how utterly unready for a dying hour: I will give you the Scripture ſtate of your caſe; you are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> under whole loads and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of ſcarlet, crimſon guilt; <hi>without Chriſt, without hope, without God in the world; alienated, and enemies in your

And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41049:39"/>what an unready poſture are you in for Death and Eternity?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how great a thing it is to be ready for Death, ready indeed, and to have all things ſet right, and in order, againſt a dying hour comes; and how much is requiſite in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 'Tis a great ſaying of an holy man: <hi>No one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can joyfully welcom Death, but he that has been long compoſing his Spirit, and making ready for it.</hi> O my (beloved) to be indeed ready to quit the World, to go into the Divine Preſence, the great, the holy, glorious preſence of God; to be ready to enter upon the Beatifical Viſion, to poſſeſs a Manſion in the Father's Houſe, to joyn with an heavenly Hoſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Spirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, in eternal praiſing, admiring, and adoring of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: Believe it, this is a great thing, and great things are requiſite thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: This calls for a near Union with Chriſt, a firm peace with God, clear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven; for much grace and holineſs, much heavenlineſs and ſpirituality of mind, much weanedneſs from this World, much holy deadneſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41049:39"/>to ſin, ſelf, and the Creature, much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Corruption, much Soul-cleanſing: much purity of heart and affections, much diligence and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Duties: And (my Beloved) are theſe little things, or things eaſie to be accompliſhed and attained unto? O Sirs! The Scripture ſpeaking of theſe things, calls upon us <hi>to ſtrive,</hi> Luke 13.24. <hi>to give all diligence</hi> in the purſuit of them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 10. To manage and diſpatch them <hi>with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> 2.12. All which tells us, that they are great things, and not eaſily to be accompliſhed and attained unto: Therefore we had need look after this, and neglect no longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider what lets and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, difficulties and oppoſitions you muſt expect to meet withall in your minding and managing this Work: Not only is the Work it ſelf great; but you muſt alſo expect many lets and hindrances, much difficulty and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the managing of it: You muſt expect lets and oppoſitions, from the Devil, he is the Enemy of Souls; and you muſt expect, that he will make uſe of all his wiles, methods, and devices,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41049:40"/>all his craft and cunning, all his Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and that he will ſtir up all his wrath and malice againſt you: he is your Enemy, and he is a ſubtil Enemy, a potent Enemy, an indefatigable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, an Enemy <hi>that always goes about, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. You muſt expect lets and oppoſitions from the World too; from the men of the world, from the things of the world, from the ſmiles of the world, from the frowns of the world. The world is your Enemy, as well as the Devil: So much is intimated, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. and you muſt expect oppoſition from it: The men of the world will diſcourage you; the things of the world will divert you; the troubles of the world will mightily depreſs you; the enjoyments of the world will miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enſnare and entangle you: The world is of a marvellous bewitching, enſnaring and entangling nature: it is indeed oppoſite to God, and all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſo to the whole intereſt of our ſouls. <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity to God, Jam.</hi> 1.4.

And ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Demas <hi>hath farſaken us, having embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10.</p>
               <p>You muſt expect lets and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo from your own hearts; yea, from them above all others: <hi>The heart</hi> (the Holy Ghoſt tells us) <hi>is deceitful above all things, and diſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Jer.</hi> 17.9. And who of us does at all obſerve it, and the workings of it, does not find it to be ſo? Now it will openly oppoſe you then it will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſeduce and enſnare you: Now it will carry you off, and draw you back from God and Duty, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.12. then it will turn you aſide to ſin and vanity, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.20. Now it will divert you from Duty, then it will make you dead and ſlothful in Duty: 'Tis indeed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet againſt all that is good; and it has a thouſand wayes to hinder you in your Great Work; and you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that it will do its utmoſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you; This is a cloſe Enemy, it is alwayes at hand; there is no end of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41049:41"/>its oppoſition, till life it ſelf ends. One of the Ancients (I remember) breaks out into a ſad exclamation againſt his own heart thus: <hi>My heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a wicked heart, a vain heart, a roving, a wandring heart: My mind is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light, wonderful unconſtant, a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, and a fugitive; it changes it ſelf into all ſhapes, it will, and it will not; 'tis like a leaf, moved and carried about with the wind: My vain and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heart hales me now to the Market, and then to ſtrifes and brawlings; now to feaſting, and then to impure luſts; now the fleſh is inflamed with ſordid titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the mind is defiled with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy cogitations.</hi> And who of us may not make the ſame complaint? yea, ſuch is the enmity and oppoſition of our own hearts againſt Heaven, and the things of Heaven, that many times when we moſt reſolve, and ſet our ſelves to follow God, and to purſue the work of our ſouls, then they ſet us moſt back. It was a great ſpeech of that ſame Father: <hi>This</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is my dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe, with my whole ſtrength I bend to thee, and would mount up to God and Heaven; but by how much the more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41049:41"/>ſtrongly I endeavour to come up to thee, by ſo much the more powerfully I am caſt into the earth, into my ſelf, and even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf, captivated to my luſts.</hi> And ſo 'tis often with us: Lets then and oppoſitions muſt be expected by us on all hands; and we had need therefore the more to awaken to our work. 'Tis true, if you will ingage in good earneſt in the work of your ſouls, your helps and incouragements will be greater, than your l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now lay all theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſee if it be an eaſie matter to make ready for a dying hour; and if it be not, why ſhould we neglect? Why ſhould we delay any longer?</p>
               <p n="6">6. How terrible will death be to you! And what a dreadful change will it make with you, in caſe you ſtill neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to make ready for it! Suppoſe (my Beloved) you go on in the neglect of this Great Concern, <hi>putting far from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41049:42"/>you the evil day;</hi> what (think you) will the iſſue of it be? will not death be moſt terrible to you, when you ſhall be called to conflict with it? Will it not make a dreadful change with you? Surely it will. Death to an unready ſoul, what will it be? It will be the period of all his mercies, of all his comforts, of all his hopes: For ſuch an one receives all his good things in this life, before death comes, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. It will be the ſending of him to his own place; the cutting him down as fewel for everlaſting burnings: It will be (as a worthy Divine ſpeaks) <hi>the taking up of a Draw-bridge, and the pulling up of the Flood-gates of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wrath, to let in the deluge of it upon his ſoul for ever:</hi> It will be a change to him; but what change will it be? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very ſad one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A change from Earth to Hell: And is not this a ſad Change? <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be turned into Hell, and all that forget God, Pſalm.</hi> 19.17. And we read of <hi>the rich man</hi> (who was unready for death) <hi>that being dead, he was in Hell, Luke</hi> 22.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A change from Light to Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41049:42"/>and is not that a ſad change? The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of ſuch an one, tells us; <hi>God ſhall drive him out of light into darkneſs, and chaſe him out of the world, Job.</hi> 18.18. Here wicked men enjoy the light of Creature comforts, but God will drive them out of theſe, into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Eternal miſery, into <hi>utter darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 25.30. into <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs,</hi> Jude 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A change from pleaſure to pain, from delight to torment: a ſad change it is, from pleaſure and delight in ſin, to pain and torment for ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. Here the ſoul ſports himſelf in the pleaſures and delights of ſin, and he thinks he can never have enough; but then there will be an end of all thoſe pleaſures and delights, and nothing but pain, and torment, and vexation will ſucceed them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A change from the offers of Grace, to the Revelations of Wrath: <hi>Shall thy loving kindneſs be declared in the grave, or thy faithfulneſs in deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) in that 88 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. True in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. we read of <hi>Chriſt's preaching by his Spirit to the Spirits in Priſon,</hi> that is, to Souls in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41049:43"/>Hell: But mark, when was it that he preach'd to them? not when in priſon, but in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> when they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world. There is never an offer of grace and love made to ſouls in the Grave; while life laſts, the ſoul hears the joyful ſound: And O the ſweet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, the gracious tenders, the loving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, that are made to him of Chriſt, of Grace, of Eternal Life and Love! O the wooings, the meltings, the entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the allurings of Divine Love to and over the ſoul! but when death comes, farewell all theſe, farewell all the ſweet offers of Chriſt, and all the bleſſed motions of the Spirit; then there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wrath reveiled, and wrath ſhall come on the neglecting ſoul to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A change from fair probabilities to utter impoſſibilities of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; a ſad change ſtill: <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> now, and not hereafter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Now there is a fair probability for the worſt of ſinners to be ſaved, if they will look after Salvation, and mind their Eternal Concerns, Chriſt is both able and willing to ſave: to ſave was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41049:43"/>the end of his coming into the world, and of all he did and ſuffered here, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Now they are beſought and entreated to be reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. but when death comes, that changes theſe fair Probabilities into utter impoſſibilities of life and ſalvation: Therefore mark, <hi>Now</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>is the day of ſalvation;</hi> that is, now while life laſts, and while the Goſpel is preached.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A change from hope to deſpair; a ſad change indeed. We read, that <hi>the hopes of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh, Job.</hi> 8.13. and that <hi>the expectation of the wicked ſhall periſh, Prov.</hi> 10.28. Whether men be open ſinners, or cloſe hypocrites, their hopes at laſt ſhall all fail, and turn into deſpair, deſpair of ever ſeeing God, or enjoying the leaſt tittle or <hi>Iota</hi> of good for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus death will be terrible to you, and make a dreadful change with you, in caſe you neglect to make ready for its coming; 'twill affright you as bad as the hand-writing upon the wall did that proud King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Which made his countenance change, his thoughts to trouble him, and the joynts of his loyns

Wilt thou then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get grace and pardon? Alas! it will be too late; then the <hi>door will be ſhut</hi> againſt thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. Wilt thou then deſire others to ſpare thee ſome of their Oyl? Alas! that will be a vain thing; they will tell thee, they have but enough for themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9.

Wilt thou call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocks and Mountains to cover thee, and hide thee from the wrath of him that ſits upon the Throne? Alas! it wil be in vain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. <hi>latter end.</hi> O ſinner! when thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf launching out into the great Ocean of Eternity, and God ſhall, as it were ſay to thee by the Mouth of thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; Well now, time and days are at an end with you, and will never dawn more, what haſt thou done for thy Soul? What proviſion haſt thou made for another world? Is Chriſt thine? haſt thou gotten thy ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? and the like. When it ſhall be thus (I ſay) what wilt thou then do and whither wilt thou then look? how wilt thou then cry out, Undone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I am loſt for ever, my day is ended, and my work is ſtill to do? woe is me! what a God, a Chriſt, a Heaven, a Bleſſedneſs, a Glory, have I wilfully and fooliſhly loſt? truly thou, and ſuch as thou, are the only perſons whoſe death will be truly lamentable. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41049:46"/>a ſaying I have read in one of the Ancients: <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are to be bewailed in their death, whom the Devils drag away to the torments of the Infernal Pit, not they whom the holy Angels do conduct to the joys of Paradiſe, they are to be bewailed, who after death are by the Devils turned into Hell; and not they, who by the Angels are placed or ſet down in Heaven.</hi> O that theſe things might convince you of your folly, and awaken your ſouls; and that ſo, as yet to know the things of your peace in your day, and the time of your viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Why (my Beloved) you are ſhortly to paſs under that great and laſt Change, a Change from Time to Eternity; and will you have no care, no ſolicitude, to make ready for that Change? if you are to take a journey, though but a few miles, or to make a Voyage into a ſtrange Land, O how are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have all things ready, all things in a prepared poſture, in order

And (my Beloved) ſhould you not be as careful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to prepare, and ſet all things right for the great buſineſs of your ſouls in another world?

And if after all you would indeed addreſs to this great work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, then I have ſeveral great and weighty directions to propound to you for your help therein; of which ſome more general, ſome more particular; and I would ſpeak of each diſtinctly.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Wherein are propounded ſeveral general directions, in order to a through prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Soul for a dying hour.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WOuld you indeed ſet all things right in your ſouls, make all ready for a dying hour? then in your moſt proſperous and flouriſhing ſtate here, maintain a frequent and ſerious remembrance of death and the grave upon your ſpirits. <hi>If a man live many years</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>and rejoyce in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkneſs; for they are many,</hi> Eccl. 11.8. By the days of darkneſs here we are to underſtand death, and the ſtate of death; the abode of our bodies in the grave, which is <hi>a Land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and where the light is as darkneſs, Job,</hi> 10.20. Now, ſaith he, though a man live many years, and rejoyce in them all; that is, <hi>though a man live long and proſperouſly, long and joyfully;</hi> yet let him remember death, and the grave, the future ſtate: 'Tis true, there are other days of darkneſs, which we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41049:49"/>are ſubject to in this world, and ſhould be remembred by us, days of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward darkneſs, the darkneſs of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble and affliction: and days of inward darkneſs, the darkneſs of ſpiritual diſtreſs and dereliction: and indeed 'tis of marvellous uſe to us in our proſperity to remember theſe days of darkneſs; but eſpecially we ſhould remember death and the Grave; we ſhould carry a lively remembrance of theſe days of darkneſs daily upon us; and indeed our not remembring theſe days of darkneſs, is one great cauſe why we are ſo unready for Death, and the Grave, as we are. When we are in the midſt of our enjoyments, and the ſtreams run pleaſantly about us, we are too apt to forget theſe days of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we are ſo taken with our earthly comforts, that we are loth to think of Death and Eternity, <hi>putting far from us the evil day;</hi> as thoſe in their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3. And therefore, when theſe days come, they find us ſo unready, and our ſpiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo diſcompoſed, as uſually they do. But (my Beloved) as ever you would have all right, and in order in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41049:50"/>your ſouls, againſt a dying hour comes, let me recommend this to you, as one ſpecial help, maintain a deep and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent remembrance of Death and the Grave upon your Spirits, remember the days of darkneſs; and that eſpecially theſe two ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Remember them ſo, as to have them much in your meditation: be much and frequent in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death and the Grave: This the Holy Ghoſt calls a <hi>conſidering our latter end;</hi> and withal, mentions it as a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of great importance to us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. To conſider, is to revolve a thing in our minds, and to keep it much in our thoughts and meditations. And thus we ſhould conſider our latter end, and remember the days of darkneſs: this is that the Saints of old have been much converſant in; they were much and frequent in the thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of death: as I might inſtance in the good old Patriarchs, <hi>Job, David,</hi> and others: And 'tis what does mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly conduce to our preparation for it. <hi>The meditation of death</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is life:</hi> it is that which greatly promotes our ſpiritual life: therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41049:50"/>walk much among the Tombs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe much and frequently with the thoughts of a dying hour.</item>
                  <item>2. Remember them ſo, as to have them daily in your expectation. In the midſt of all your enjoyments, expect Deaths approach daily: this is called <hi>a waiting for our change. All the days of my appointed time, will I wait, till my change comes,</hi> Job 14.14. And we are commanded <hi>to wait for the coming of our Lord,</hi> as that which lies in the directeſt tendency to the exacteſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preparation for his coming: Luke 12.36. <hi>Expect death every hour,</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>for 'tis every hour approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee: In the morning, when thou riſeſt, think with thy ſelf, this may be the laſt day: In the evening, when thou lyeſt down, think with thy ſelf, this may be the laſt night I may ever have in this world; I know not when my Lord will come, whether in the morning, or in the evening, at mid-night, or at the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowing: therefore I will be always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his coming.</hi> Woe, and alas for us! we are apt to talk of many years yet to come, as he did, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.9. whereas we ſhould live in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41049:51"/>of death every moment. Thus let us conſider the days of darkneſs, it will marvellouſly conduce to the preparation of the Soul for them: the meditation and expectation of death will conduce much (among others) to theſe four things.
<list>
                        <item>1. It will conduce much to our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and ſelf-abaſing: <hi>Let a man own himſelf to be a mortal</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>and pride will, it muſt down:</hi> And <hi>think frequently of death,</hi> (ſaith another) <hi>and thou wilt eaſily bring down thy proud heart.</hi> Hence alſo the conſideration of Death is often in Scripture mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt, as an argument to make us humble: <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3.19. as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</item>
                        <item>2. It will conduce much to the wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our hearts from this world, and to the looſening of them from the things here below: <hi>The time is ſhort,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>what then? Why it remaineth, that they that have Wives, be as though they had none; and thoſe that weep, as though they wept not; and thoſe that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; thoſe that buy, as though they poſſeſſed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41049:51"/>not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29, 30, 31. He mentions the ſhortneſs of time, as that the meditation and expectation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, has the directeſt tender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> in it, to wean and looſen the heart from all things here below. And indeed (as St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> hath it) <hi>he eaſily contemns all things here, who looks upon himſelf as dying daily.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. It will conduce much to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the heart to Heaven, and the things of Heaven, to a ſerious purſuit of a bleſſed Eternity. So we find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. &amp;c. <hi>Thoſe all dyed in the Faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not having received the Promiſes; but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed, that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the earth;</hi> that is, they were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive they had but a little time to ſtay here: And what then? <hi>They deſire a better Countrey, that is, an Heavenly:</hi> the apprehenſion they had of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hence, quickned them unto earneſt deſires and purſuits after the better Countrey, the Heavenly Land: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41049:52"/>one great reaſon why we breath no more, and preſs no more after Heaven, and a bleſſed Eternity, is; becauſe we ſo ſeldom remember theſe dayes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                        <item>4. It will conduce much to the quickning of the Heart to Duty, and to diligence, and faithfulneſs therein, Chriſt himſelf made uſe of it for this end: <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work,</hi> Jo. 9.4. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo that holy Apoſtle, made uſe of it to that end: <hi>I will not be negligent</hi> ſaith he) to do ſo and ſo in the way of my Duty; <hi>as knowing that ſhortly I ſhall put off this Tabernacle,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14. The conſideration of the near approach of his death, quickned him to his Work and Duty? And the Scripture propounds it, as that which has a tendency to this thing: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>for there is no work nor counſel in the grave, whither thou art going,</hi> Eccl. 9.10. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the conſideration of our going to the Grave, as a means to quicken us to our preſent Work. By all which we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41049:52"/>ſee, how much the ſerious remembrance of the dayes of darkneſs muſt needs contribute to our readineſs and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs for theſe dayes: Therefore be much in this work. For my own part, I have hardly found any one thing more quickning and engaging upon my Spirit, than this: And Souls, I would beg you, as you would live for ever, think often of death.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Would you indeed ſet all things right in your ſouls, and make all ready for a dying hour? Then be not fond of long life here in this World, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covet to live, as much as poſſible, in a little time: I would ſpeak of each diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be not fond of long life here in this World. A fond hope and deſire of long life here, is one of the greateſt Enemies to a true preparation of Soul for our departure hence. For pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, take a man that is fond of long life here, and all his thoughts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are for this World: He is wholly taken up about, and carried out after the concerns of Time, ſcarce allowing himſelf one ſerious thought for Death and Eternity: A ſad inſtance you have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41049:53"/>hereof in the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. he reckoned upon many years, upon a long life here; and what are the things he is taken up about? verily the things of this world only, the increaſe of his Goods, and where to ſtore his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: Fond hopes, and deſires of long life here, will certainly produce great delays, if not utter neglects, in the great work and concern of your Souls and Eternity: As ever therefore you would have all right and well in the concerns of your ſouls, when you come to die, be not fond of long life here; but ſit as looſe in your thoughts, hopes, and deſires, both of this life, and all the enjoyments of it, as poſſibly you can. And indeed (my Beloved) to reaſon it a little with you, why ſhould you be fond of long life here? why ſhould you covet a long ſtay in this world? I would only plead with you in two things as to this.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What is this world, and what have we here, that we ſhould here co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet a long ſtay? is this world ſuch a ſweet, ſuch an amiable, ſuch a deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, it is an angry world, a frowning world, a dirty world, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41049:53"/>enſnaring world: 'Tis a waſte howling Wilderneſs, a ſtrange Land, an houſe of Bondage, a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, tempeſtuous Sea, an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of Blood: ſuch I am ſure 'tis oftentimes to the poor Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: And what have we here? Why here we have <hi>fears within, and fightings without, troubles on every ſide,</hi> and from all hands; from friends, from enemies, from men, from devils: here we have ſorrows, ſnares, loſſes, wounds, deaths, dangers, temptations, ſeducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſappointments, <hi>vexation of ſpirit;</hi> and truly little elſe is to be expected by us here, except that which is worſe than all this, <hi>viz.</hi> dayly riſings and ebolitions of luſt, violent eruptions of corruption, great aboundings of ſin and iniquity, both in our ſelves and, others; continual breakings with God and departings from him, renewing and increaſing ſin and guilt dayly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this world is full of ſin, and temptation to ſin: 'Tis (as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaks of it) <hi>tota tentatio,</hi> all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and as it is all temptation ſo 'tis little elſe but ſin: and why ſhould we covet a long ſtay here?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41049:54"/>
                     <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith one of the Ancients) <hi>ſhould we ſo much deſire that life, in which, by how much the longer we live, by ſo much the more we ſin; and the more numerous our days are, the more numerous will our ſins be?</hi> who would deſire to ſtay long in a Priſon, or a Dungeon, in a ſtate and place of ſin and ſorrow? and ſuch is this world.</item>
                  <item>2. Is there not a better life, a better place, a better ſtate for our ſouls to long and aſpire after? what do you think of the life above, a whole Eternity ſpent in the Divine Preſence, in the boſom of Divine Love, a life of love, a life of pleaſure, a life of joy, a life or admiration, a life of holineſs, perfect and unſpotted holineſs, a life every way correſpondent to the Divine Life, and the Divine Will? is not this a better life? <hi>to be with Chriſt is beſt of all, Phil.</hi> 1.23. To poſſeſs a manſion in our Father's Houſe, prepared by our Lord and Head, Jeſus Chriſt, for us: to live for ever in the viſion and fruition of Father, Son, and Spirit: to dwell in the Heavenly City, where no unclean thing can enter: to joyn in with the glorious Hoſt of Saints, and Angels above, and with them to ſpend a whole Eternity in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41049:54"/>Songs of Praiſe and Hallelujahs to God, and the Lamb: to take up all our waters at the Fountain head; and indeed to dive and bathe unchangeably in the Fountain of all delights at the Father's right hand: Oh how ſweet is this life, and how much to be deſired by us? In a word (my beloved) the Saints, when in the beſt frame, have many of them been ſo far from being fond of long life here, that indeed they have thought it long till the time came, when they ſhould go hence, and be no more, crying out with an holy impatiency; <hi>Why is his Chariot ſo long a coming? why tarry the wheels of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Covet to live much in a little time: 'Tis ſaid of that Reverend and worthy Divine, Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> that he deſired to, and accordingly did, live much in a little time. And our Lord himſelf (you know) did not live long in this world; but he lived much in a little time: he did much work in a few days for God and ſouls. And indeed (my beloved) 'tis not a long life, but a fruitful life, that is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, moſt deſirable, and moſt like his life, who is life it ſelf. 'Tis not he that lives many years, but he that lives
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41049:55"/>much in a few years, that is the moſt happy ſoul. I know thoſe, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is not to live long, but to live fruitfully, and to do as much, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they can, in a little time: and might they have their option or choice, it would be this, to live much in a little time, and then have their diſmiſſion to reſt. And (my Beloved) let this be your choice, and your ambition; be caſting about in your ſelves, how you may live much in a little time; how you may compaſs much ſpiritual work and buſineſs in a few days: Labour to treaſure up much grace, much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of God, and his love; to bring a large revenue of glory to him, and the like: And for this end poſſeſs your ſouls with a deep ſenſe of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth and preciouſneſs of time; and accordingly ſet your ſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it, looking upon the loſs thereof to be the greateſt loſs in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. we are commanded to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time:</hi> And what is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time, but to eſteem time as precious, as a thing of incomparable worth and value; and accordingly to make the beſt and higheſt improvement
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41049:55"/>of it for the honour of God, and good of our ſouls, that poſſibly we can? It is to fill up our time with duty, and our duties with grace: to make uſe of time for thoſe ends, for which time is given us; not to eat, and drink, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace our ſelves in the Creature, but to ſerve and honour the Creator; to <hi>work out our Salvation;</hi> to get acquaintance with God and Chriſt; to make ſure of Heaven, and a bleſſed Eternity. O Sirs, look upon time as precious; ſo indeed it is: Time is the moſt weighty and momentous thing in the world, 'tis that which our eternal all depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: According as we do, or do not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and improve our time well, ſo will it go with us for ever. 'Tis a ſweet meditation which I have read in a diſcourſe of a holy man: <hi>This life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ours is moſt ſwift; and yet in it Eternal Life is either gotten or loſt for ever: This life of ours is moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; and yet in it Eternal Happineſs is either gotten or loſt for ever.</hi> No leſs than a whole Eternity of Happineſs, or Miſery, Salvation, or Damnation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our uſe and management of our little time here in this world,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41049:56"/>
                  <hi>As the tree falls, ſo it lies,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.3. As it is with us, when we go out of time, ſo it will be with us to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and this we ſhould be much in the thoughts of, accounting therefore the loſs of time to be the greateſt loſs. 'Tis a weighty ſaying, which I have read in one of the Ancients: <hi>It is a great and heavy loſs indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do good nor think good</hi> (and let me add nor get good) <hi>but we ſuffer our hearts to wander abroad, about vain and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things: and yet it is too difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain or keep them back from theſe things.</hi> Truly no loſs like the loſs of time: the loſs of eſtate, the loſs of Trade, the loſs of this or the other outward comfort is nothing to the loſs of time: theſe, being loſt, may be recovered again: but time being loſt can never be recovered more: accordingly ſet your ſelves to redeem it, and do it as much as poſſible you can; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting that day loſt, wherein you have not done ſomething for God, and your ſouls: the truth is we live no more than we are converſant in the work of God and our ſouls; For, as for that which we call life, that is not ſpent in this work, it is not indeed to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:41049:56"/>
Thirdly, would you indeed ſet all things right in your ſouls, make all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a dying hour? then think much, and often with your ſelves, how great a change, death will make with you, when ever it comes: death is a change, and in many reſpects, the greateſt change, which the Sons of men are to paſs through: <hi>all the days of my appointed time, will I wait, till my change come,</hi> Job, 14.14. <hi>Job</hi> had many changes, and great changes; <hi>Changes and war were upon him,</hi> as he complains, <hi>Job,</hi> 10.17. But no change like this of death; this was the great change, and this he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all his days: indeed, death is a great change to every man and woman; come when, and how it will: 'tis that (as you have heard) that deprives men of all their enjoyments here; which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the union between ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which turns the body to duſt and putrifaction; and (which is unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more than this) it is that, through which the ſoul enters into the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preſence of God, and ſtates it in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; it is a change from time to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, from work to reward; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuitable to the work we have here
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41049:57"/>been doing, whether it be good or evil; and is not this a great change? Take a few hints in particular about it, to ſhew the greatneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is ſuch a change, as all other changes upon the outward man, are but leading, and introductory unto, and into which at laſt they all iſſue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve themſelves; we paſs through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny changes here in this world; we may ſay as <hi>Job, Changes and war are upon us;</hi> but theſe are but leading and prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as it were, to this laſt and great Change: theſe all are, or ſhould be to us, Monitors of this laſt Change, and do but a little darkly ſhadow it out unto us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſuch a change, as calls for great ſpiritual changes to paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us here, to ſit and prepare us for it; a change in our minds, a change in our wills, a change in our affections, a change in our converſations, a change in our whole man; a real change, a thorough change, an univerſal change; <hi>Old things muſt be done away, and all things muſt become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. The mind muſt be changed from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, from ignorance to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41049:57"/>in ſpiritual things: The will muſt be changed from enmity to ſubjection, from rebellion to obedience to God and his Laws: the affections muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from earthlineſs to heavenlineſs, from carnality to ſpirituality; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation muſt be changed from ſin to holineſs, from vanity and looſneſs, to ſtrictneſs and ſeriouſneſs in walking with God; Oh how great muſt that change be, that calls for ſo many, and ſo great changes, to ſit and prepare us for it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſuch a change, as though it do not put us out of being, yet it puts us into a quite other manner of being, than ever we yet had; a change which ſets us naked before the Tribunal of God, to receive a definitive ſentence of life or death from him; a change which brings us into the immediate ſight of God, either as a gracious Father, or as a revenging Judg; a change, which fully opens the eyes of the ſoul, and makes him to ſee both grace and ſin, heaven and hell; grace in its amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſin in its odiouſneſs, heaven in its glory, and hell in its horrour: for (my Beloved) whatever we are, whether
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41049:58"/>good or bad, Saints or Sinners; yet when we die, our eyes will be fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, to ſee theſe things; we ſhall ſee unutterable things; if we be good, we ſhall ſee them with joy and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; if we be bad, we ſhall ſee them with anguiſh and confuſion of ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is ſuch a change, as makes us capable of, and actually puts us into, unſpeakably greater things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of happineſs or miſery, comfort or confuſion, than ever here we knew, or were capable of; a change, which in one moment, in the twinkling of an eye, carries the ſoul from ſmall firſt fruits to the full vintage; from a few drops to a bottomleſs boundleſs Ocean of either Happineſs or vengeance, Delight or Torment. And withal there leaves him without any poſſibility of change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration for ever, but that, of its reunion with the body: for it is ſuch a change as leaves the ſtate of the ſoul for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable: Oh then, think much and often with your ſelves, how great a change death will make with you; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did men think, and conſider with themſelves; how great a change death
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41049:58"/>will make with them, when it comes, they would not leave the matters of their ſouls in ſuch diſorders and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, in ſuch an unready poſture for it, as they do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Would you indeed ſet all right in your Souls, and make all ready for a dying hour? then, preſently ſet upon Soul-work without admitting of the leaſt delay or procraſtination upon any account whatſoever: delays, and procraſtinations in the work of our Souls and Eternity, is the High-way to death and ruine: what was it that ruined the fooliſh Virgins, but their delays in this great work, and their neglect of the great concerns of their ſoul, till it was too late to mind them? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>begin. Felix</hi> alſo was in a fair way, and had a fair opportunity before him, to have provided for another world; but he delayed, and his delay (for ought we know) was his ruine, <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.25. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heart is very apt to delay and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate Soul-work: it is apt to cry out to morrow, to morrow; hence it is that the Scripture calls ſo often upon us for a ſpeedy engaging in the work of our ſouls; the Scripture ſaith <hi>now</hi> and to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41049:59"/>
                  <hi>day; now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. And <hi>to day, if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3.7, 8. And if the Scripture ſaith now why ſhouldſt thou talk of hereafter? If the Scripture ſaith to day, why ſhouldſt thou talk of to morrow? <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth this, and withal tells us there is ſcarce any end of delays, if once we give way to them: <hi>I delayed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be converted to God, and put off my living to him from day to day.</hi> And elſewhere he tells us, that when God called upon him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake to his work, he returned nothing but a few ſleepy words, <hi>Anon Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>anon, bear with me a little, but this anon and anon had no end; and this bear with me a little, went on a long way.</hi> Take heed of this; this hath been the ruine of thouſands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: how many have been convinced that it is their duty, and intereſt both, to fall in with the work of God and their Souls, to make preparation for another world? but they have put it off till hereafter, and ſatisfied their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with reſolutions hereafter to do ſo and ſo; and have thus loſt their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41049:59"/>ſeaſon: Oh fall preſently without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, upon Soul-work: and to quicken you a little hereunto, conſider four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the unreaſonableneſs of delays; no juſt Plea can be made, nor true account given, why you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay your Soul-work one moment: the Devil, and a man's own heart, will make many Pleas, but no juſt Plea can be made; they will tell you, it is too ſoon, you are young, and have time enough before you: what need you engage ſo ſoon? but is this a rational Plea? Is it too ſoon to be ſaved, too ſoon to be happy, too ſoon to ſecure your eteraal intereſt? is it too ſoon to lay hold on eternal life? Is it too ſoon to know and enjoy God? Is it too ſoon to be out of danger of periſhing eternally? Why truly it cannot be too ſoon for theſe things; beſides, God calls for thy youth, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth,</hi> Eccl. 12.1. And he greatly values the kindneſs of thy youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. Again, they will ſuggeſt, that ſuch and ſuch a buſineſs muſt be diſpatched, ſuch a work done and carried off your hands; and then you may attend this work:

                  <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he to Chriſt) <hi>I will follow thee; but ſuffer me firſt to go bury my father;</hi> and ſaith another, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee; but firſt, let me go, and bid them farewell, which are at home</hi> Luk. 9.57, 61. But friends, let me ask you, if there be any buſineſs to be diſpatched, like the buſineſs of your Souls, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? is there any thing upon your hand, that is of ſo much worth; as your ſouls? and of ſo much weight as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? is there any thing, you are ſo nearly concerned to mind, as that, which is indeed the one thing neceſſary, even the ſaving of your ſouls? Oh the whole world is nothing to this, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernments on earth, are but trifles to this concern. Again, they will tell you, it is an inconvenient ſeaſon, and hereafter the work may be better done, and minded by you, than now it can; which was <hi>Felix</hi> his caſe, in the place before mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. But hearken ſoul, art thou ſure, of another ſeaſon? and art thou ſure, that that will be a more convenient ſeaſon? ſurely no, if it be not convenient to day, thou mayſt fear, it will be leſs convenient to morrow, that Devil, and deceitful
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41049:62"/>heart that tells thee it is not convenient now, will make proviſion, that it ſhall be leſs convenient hereafter, O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, break through all theſe pleas, and fall ſpeedily upon ſoul work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the danger of delayes: delayes in this caſe are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous, one dayes, yea (for any thing I know) one hours delay herein, may prove thine eternal undoing; it may prove the loſs of Chriſt, the loſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the loſs of thy ſoul, and all for ever; Alas! Art thou ſure, thou ſhalt live one day, one hour more in this world: for ought thou knoweſt, the next mornent, thou goeſt down into the grave <hi>Job</hi> 21.13. But in caſe, thou ſhouldeſt live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the world, art thou ſure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the means of Grace, ſhall be continued to thee? if thou ſhouldeſt not be taken from the world, yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may be taken from thee; though the day of thy life may laſt a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; yet the day of Goſpel Grace and mercy may ſuddenly expire; and if that be once gone, all the tenders of Chriſt, all the offers of Grace, all the exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life and ſalvation are gone, if the Goſpel be once gone, thy ſeaſon is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41049:63"/>gone, and thy Soul is gone, and thy Salvation is gone, and that for ever; therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now is the accepted time,</hi> ſpeaking of the day of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-mercy, <hi>now is the day of Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Or grant thou ſhouldeſt live, and the Goſpel ſhould be continued to thee, as the outward means; yet art thou ſure, that the day and ſeaſon of grace will laſt any longer than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment? remember that ſad word which our Lord breathed out with tears in his eyes, over neglecting <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luk. 19.42. <hi>O that thou hadſt known, at leaſt in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> Alas! how ſoon may God withdraw his Spirit from thee? how ſoon may he call home his grieved Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from thy neglecting, reſiſting ſoul, once for all, ſaying my Spirit ſhall ſtrive no more with that man? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. how ſoon may God ſeal thee up under judicial blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, ſo that thou ſhalt never be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or to do any thing for the good of thy ſoul, in order to the other world? thou talkeſt of to morrow, and of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but who knows, but that before
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41049:63"/>to morrow, God may clap the ſeal of an hard heart, and a blind mind upon thee; ſo as that though thou ſhouldeſt live a thouſand years, and withal enjoy the faireſt means that ever any ſoul enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet thou ſhouldeſt be never able to believe, to repent, to do any thing for the working out of thy Salvation? it is often times his way of proceeding with neglecting, delaying ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.39, 40. Or how ſoon may the Oath of God go forth againſt thee? thou talkeſt of to morrow; but alas! who knows but that before to morrow, <hi>God may ſwear in his wrath thou ſhalt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reſt:</hi> it is what is threatned againſt ſuch as will not hear his voice to day, but harden their hearts againſt him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. There is a time when God's Oath goeth forth againſt ſuch and ſuch ſinners, for their contempt and neglect of Chriſt and Grace; a time, not only when God ſaith, but ſweareth and that in wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his reſt; and if once Gods oath is gone out againſt a man, that man is paſt recovery: then farewell Chriſt, and Heaven, and Soul, and all for ever: O how dangerous are delays! therefore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41049:64"/>take heed of them, and fall preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoul work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider the diſadvantage of delayes! delayes herein are diſadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as well as dangerous; indeed were there no danger in them (I mean as to the eternal ſtate) yet the diſadvantage of them is ſo great, as, if rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, might be enough to antidote the ſoul againſt them; and engage it preſently in the work which relates to another world. Pray conſider it a little: by delayes the ſoul loſeth much ſweet communion with Chriſt, and many a bleſſed communication of love from him, which he might enjoy: the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we fall upon the work of heaven and eternity, the ſooner we come to a taſte and beginning of heaven, and a bleſſed eternity in our ſouls; O the ſweet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, braces, the bleſſed diſcoveries, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incomes of love, and delight that the ſoul loſes, by his delayes to get into Chriſt, and to walk with God, and to mind eternal concernments! Poor ſoul, by thy delayes, thou haſt lived upon husks and ſwill, all thy dayes hitherto; whereas thou mighteſt have eaten bread in thy Fathers houſe, and drunk wine
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41049:64"/>new in thy Fathers kingdom: thou haſt lived on the muddy, dungy droſſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of fin and the creature, whereas thou mighteſt have ſolaced and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſoul with thoſe chryſtal ſtreams of undefiled pleaſures, which are at Chriſts and the Fathers right hand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides by delayes the work of thy ſoul grows more difficult; hereby corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grows more ſtrong, and the heart grows more hard, by every dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, the old enmity ſtrengthens it ſelf, and the ſoul is more and more ſetled upon its lees; for accuſtomedneſs in ſinning hardens the heart in ſin, as is hinted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. every day the ſoul is more alienated from Chriſt, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened againſt him, at beſt, if thy ſoul doth at laſt come to ſee thy need of Chriſt, and deſireth to cloſe with him, and to mind the work and concerns of another world; yet the longer thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeſt this buſineſs; the greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thou wilt have to get over; for, though now thy heart faith it is too ſoon; yet after a few dayes delay, it will ſay it is too late; it will be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that now thy day is over, and now Chriſt will have nothing to do with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41049:65"/>thee: Oh why ſhouldſt thou be ſuch an Enemy to thy own ſoul, as to run it upon theſe diſadvantages? rather avoid them, by falling preſently upon Soul-work.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Confider the ſinfulneſs of delays, and the horrible guilt they bring upon the ſoul: as delays are dangerous, and diſadvantagious; ſo they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful too, exceeding ſinful, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the God of Heaven: the truth is, were there no danger in them, no diſadvantage by them to the ſoul; yet the ſinfulneſs of them is ſuch, as ſhould make us afraid of them: In every days delay to mind and purſue Soul-work, there is poſitive rebellion, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Will and Command of God: for the Command is, <hi>To day, if ye will-hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3.7, 8. by delaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou rebelleſt againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: in every day's delay to mind and purſue ſoul-work, there is horrible unkindneſs and ingratitude to God and Chriſt; which ſurely is a black ſin, and brings great guilt upon the ſoul: God ſpares you time after time, when he might cut you off the next moment:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41049:65"/>and this he doth that you may purſue the work of your Souls and Eternity: and oh what unkindneſs, what ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt it be in us to neglect, and put off this work? in every delay to mind and purſue Soul-work, there is much contempt of Chriſt and Grace; and this is that whieh makes it to be exceeding ſinful: Chriſt offers himſelf, and his Grace to you, he offers you life, he offers you peace, he offers you pardon, he offers you righteouſneſs, he offers you ſtrength, he offers you all the treaſures of heaven; and withal calls upon you to accept theſe offers, and to take home theſe things to your ſelves; but you, by your delays, powre contempt upon all; you in effect ſay, neither Chriſt, nor his grace, neither Chriſt, nor the purchaſe of his Blood, are worth minding, worth looking after; Oh what contempt is this? and what ſin is this? by delays, you do in effect ſay, there is ſomething better than Chriſt, and ſomething of greater concernment to you than Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, you plainly ſay, that indeed you will have Chriſt hereafter, and Salvation hereafter; but for the preſent, you had much rather have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41049:66"/>your luſts and worldiy pleaſures, Oh tremble at the thoughts of this, and let it affright you out of your delays, and put you immediately upon Soul-work: In a word, never any pretended, that they minded the concerns of their ſouls, union with Chriſt, walking with God, making ſure their Calling and Election, ſo ſoon; many have repented, that they have minded theſe things ſo late: I remember a bitter complaint of <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Book of Confeſſions, <hi>I have loved thee too late,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>O thou ſo ancient, and yet ſo new a beauty, I have loved thee too late:</hi> He bewails that he had ſo long laid out his love upon the creature, and not given Chriſt his love; could you ask all the Saints in Heaven whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever they repented, that they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of Chriſt and their ſouls, ſo ſoon; they would tell you no, they repented of nothing, but that they minded it ſo late once more therefore let me call upon you, to fall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon Soulwork, and never reſt, till thy heart cries out to God, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> did, when God had really ſhewed him himſelf, and made him ſenſible of his ſins; <hi>when God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>had ſhewed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41049:66"/>me my ſin and miſery, there aroſe a great ſtorm within me, which carried with it a great ſhowr of tears; and indeed, I let looſe the reins to tears, crying out to God in ſuch words as theſe, O Lord, how long, how long, wilt thou be angry? how long, ſhall it be ſaid to morrow, and to morrow? wherefore may it not be now? why may there not an end be put to my ſin and filthineſs this very hour?</hi> And indeed, God made that very ſeaſon the ſeaſon of his Converſion: So labour, to ſee thy ſin and miſery ſo far, as that thou maiſt cry out with a holy reſtleſneſs to God, how long ſhall it be to morrow, and to morrow? why may I not be turned to thee now? why may not my ſoul be engaged in the work of Heaven and Eternity now?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, would you indeed ſet all right in your ſouls, and make all ready for a dying hour? then be much and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with God in prayer, to teach you ſo to number your days, as to apply your hearts to wiſdom: This I ground upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. where <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God is found in this practiſe, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>teach us ſo to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41049:67"/>unto wiſdom: To number our days, is not to number them in an Arithmetical, but a ſpiritual way; it is not to caſt up how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days the life of man conſiſts of, that is eaſily done; but it is ſpiritually and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically to conſider, and lay to heart, the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our lives, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the various miſeries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that do attend them.</hi> So <hi>Mollerus.</hi> It is ſeriouſly and fiducially to contemplate the vanity of life, as ſhort and uncertain, and as attended with ſorrows, miſeries, and innumerable troubles, and to apply the heart to wiſdom; 'tis to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the work of a man's ſoul, his main buſineſs; it is to make it his great buſineſs and endeavour, to get an intereſt in God and Chriſt, in the Covenant of Grace, and Eternal life; and in time to provide for, and make ſure of a bleſſed Eternity; it is to ſet a man's whole ſoul to the work of God, and his own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now, as ever you would indeed make ready for a dying hour, beg of God to teach you thus to number your days, and thus to apply your hearts to wiſdom: There are two things I would obſerve, and ſo cloſe this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſuch a numbring of our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41049:67"/>days, is what the beſt of Saints need, and may make great uſe of; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a very holy man, and yet he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a work uſeful, and of great importance to him, to contemplate the vanity of life, and to think of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncertainty of his abode here; the moſt holy ſouls need this; the moſt holy ſouls need humbling, they need weaning from this world, they need quickning unto duty they need to have their hearts awakened, to mind heaven, and a future life; and the right num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of our days, is that which greatly conduceth hereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve, that as this is a work needful and uſeful for the beſt of Saints to be employed in; ſo it is a work above their own ſtrength, and that which they need Divine Aſſiſtance to enable them unto: <hi>Moſes</hi> was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently holy man, and yet, as he ſaw, he had need of this, ſo he ſaw it was a work above his power; and therefore he goes to God, and puts in himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, and prays for his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings herein; let us do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Wherein more particular helps, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are laid down, in order to the ſetting of things right, and making all ready for a dying hour.</head>
               <p>BUt I would come nearer this great buſineſs, and give you ſome more particular directions, in order to your making all ready for a dying hour: and Firſt, would you indeed have all things right in the matters of your ſouls for a dying hour? then get into Chriſt, get union with Chriſt, and an intereſt in Chriſt by believing: union with Chriſt, and an intereſt in Chriſt, is moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary, to fit and prepare us for a dying hour; and without it we have, we can have nothing ſet right, nothing in order, nothing in readineſs
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41049:68"/>for that hour: You know how the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life; but he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life,</hi> 1 John, 5.12. and <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. O my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we ſhall live, or die, be ſaved, or damned for ever; according as we do, or do not get union with Chriſt, and an intereſt in Chriſt: This is what lies at the bottom and foundation of all, of all our hopes, of all our mercies, of all our comforts, of all our accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and communion with God, of all Grace on Earth, and of all Glory in Heaven: and without it, whatſoever our attainments in Religion are, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Profeſſion may be, whatever place or eſteem we may have to the Church of God though never ſo raiſed and eminent, yet we have nothing that will avail us in a dying hour. I remember a ſaying of a learned man, <hi>That thou maiſt live in death,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>get into Chriſt, implant thy ſelf into Chriſt by believing, Faith joyns and unites us to Chriſt, and they that are in Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, for Chriſt is their life:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we have union with Chriſt, he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41049:69"/>will be life in death it ſelf to us: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord;</hi> that is, die having union with Chriſt, being implanted into Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. If we have union with Chriſt, he will not be only life in death to us, but he will even turn death it ſelf into life; the King of Terrors into a King of Comforts; inſomuch that the ſoul ſhall be able to triumph over it, as the Apoſtle doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. whereas without this, without union with Chriſt, and an intereſt in Chriſt, we ſhall never be able to look death in the face with comfort, but ſhall, when we come to die, be ſome of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt ſpectacles in the world. It is the ſpeech of a worthy Divine, who is long ſince gone hence, <hi>A Chriſtleſs dying man or woman</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is one of the ſaddeſt ſpectacles in the world:</hi> For a man to be dying, and not Chriſtleſs, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, for ſuch an one dies but to live for ever; he dies the death of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to live the life of Glory: for a man to be Chriſtleſs, and not dying, is ſomething tolerable; for who knows, but that the next meeting at an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, may be the time of God's love to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41049:69"/>him of drawing him into Chriſt? but for a man to be dying and Chriſtleſs, Chriſtleſs and dying too, that is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that is terrible indeed; for ſuch an one dies to be damned, and he is going off from all hopes and poſſibilities of mercy for ever: Oh therefore, above all, preſs after union with Chriſt, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, this was <hi>Pauls</hi> great care and ſolicitude to the very laſt, that ſo he might go off the Stage with comfort; and that for which he <hi>accounted all things but dung,</hi> as moſt baſe and vile, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. O Soul, didſt thou indeed know and conſider of how much weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance an intereſt in Chriſt is to thee, with reference to thine eternal happineſs, thou would cry out as eagerly for Chriſt, as ever <hi>Rachel</hi> did for children, ſaying, Give me Chriſt, or elſe I die; give me union with Chriſt, and an intereſt in Chriſt, or I am undone eternally: Oh look to the great uniting act of Faith, make a right choice of Chriſt, chuſe him as your Lord and Head, your King and Saviour, and renew your choice of him every day, reſigning up your ſelves entirely to him, to be ſaved and governed by him in his own way.</p>

Secondly, Would you indeed have all ſet right, and made ready, in the matters of your ſouls, for a dying hour? then preſs after a firm and unſhaken aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of an intereſt in God, and his love, and of your right and title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, of another, and a better life than this is here, without ſome good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven, and ſome well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aſſurance of an intereſt in God, and Eternal Life, things are not ready with us, nor are we in ſuch a preparedneſs for a dying hour, as we ought to be; though a man hath an intereſt in God, and his love; though he hath a right and title to eternal life and happineſs; yet as long as he is in the dark, and at an uncertainty in his own ſoul about it, things are out of order with him, and he is greatly unready for a dying hour: For pray mark, as our intereſt in this is requiſite to our dying happily, ſo the ſight and aſſurance of that intereſt is requiſite to our dying comfortably. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when a man hath attained to ſome good evidence for heaven, to ſome well-grounded aſſurance of his intereſt in God and Chriſt, then are things in a good poſture with him, in reference to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41049:70"/>a dying hour, then he can play with Death, and triumph over it; as <hi>Job</hi> did, when he could ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> Job 19.25, 26. And as the Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeak of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. <hi>We know, that when our earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; for this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven:</hi> None of you do comfortably leave your houſe, unleſs you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go unto; much leſs can you comfortably quit this world, unleſs you have ſome well-grounded aſſurance of another, and a better life: Take a man that is in the dark, and at a loſs as to his intereſt in God and Chriſt, and he knows not what Death will do to him, nor where it will lodge him, whether in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or in hell, whether upon the Throne of Glory, or in the Priſon of eternal Darkneſs; in the Boſom of Chriſts love, or under the Revelations of his infinite and eternal wrath: and is ſuch a one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a dying hour? Surely no: As ever therefore you would have things right and ready within indeed for a dying
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41049:71"/>hour, you muſt preſs after an aſſurance of your intereſt in God and Chriſt; you muſt do as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. You muſt every day preſt after a fuller and firmer aſſurance, as to your eternal intereſt; you muſt be much in faith, much in prayer, much in examining your evidences, much in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your ſtate, much in looking after the ſeal and evidence of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is indeed all in all; and never reſt till you can ſay, My Lord, and my God, my Heaven, my Glory, <hi>God is the rock of my heart, and my portion for ever;</hi> O then all will be ſweet and well with you; this is that which the Saints of old have laboured after with their whole might; <hi>Say unto my ſoul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to God) <hi>I am thy ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 35.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſet me as a ſeal upon thy heart, and as a ſeal upon thine arm,</hi> Cant. 8.6. This <hi>Auſtin</hi> preſſed much after; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tell me what thou art to me, ſay unto my Soul, I am thy ſalvation; ſo ſay it that I may hear it: behold the ears of my heart are before thee, open them, O Lord and ſay unto my Soul, I am thy Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> O, my Beloved, this is worth preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41049:71"/>after; for this is the welcomeſt news a poor ſoul can poſſibly hear, to be told that God is his, and Heaven is his, and Eternal Life is his; and when once this news is come, then welcom life, and welcom death, welcom time, and welcom eternity; then the Soul can ſay, O ſweet Eternity, O bleſſed Eternity! O Sirs, be not ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good aſſurance of Gods love to your ſouls, and your right and title to heaven and eternal life; yea, without the fulleſt aſſurance that is attainable here; for know, that there are degrees in Aſſurance it ſelf; the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions three degrees of aſſurance. Firſt, there is aſſurance, <hi>The work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is peace, and the fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is aſſurance for ever,</hi> Iſa. 32.17. and <hi>give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> as in the place before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Secondly, there is much aſſurance, <hi>Our Goſpel came unto you, not in word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in power, and in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and much aſſurance,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5. Thirdly, there is a full aſſurance, <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſurance of hope unto the end,</hi> Heb. 6.11. Now, my
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41049:72"/>Beloved, I would not have you ſatisfied without aſſurance, without much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yea, without a full aſſurance; the more full your aſſurance is, the more chearfully, joyfully, and triumphingly will you die.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Would you indeed have all all right, all in order, in the matters of your ſouls, for a dying hour? then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to maintain a conſtant, actual peace with God, every day making even with him, and renewing the ſenſe of his pardoning love in your ſouls, as a firm union with Chriſt, and a well-grounded aſſurance of an intereſt in God, and eternal Life; ſo alſo, an actual peace with God, and a daily renewed pardon from him, is requiſite to a thorough readineſs and preparedneſs for a dying hour: <hi>David</hi> had an intereſt in God, yea and his intereſt was clear to him; yet how ſollicitous was he to get all even between God and him, and how uncomfortable was it with him, till he had renewed his peace with God, when by his fall it had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8, 12. This alſo is what is evidently held forth <hi>Job</hi> 7.21. where <hi>Job</hi> pleads thus with God, <hi>Why doſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41049:72"/>thou not pardon mine iniquity, and take away my tranſgreſſion? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt, thou ſhalt ſeek me in the morning, but I ſhall not be.</hi> In the verſe before, he acknowledged he had ſinned, and here he intimates, that God frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him for his ſin; the ſenſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning love was not renewed in his ſoul, which here therefore he pleads for, and that upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſpeedily to die; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he could not die with comfort, till he had a renewed ſenſe of Gods pardoning love: And this is the very thing which <hi>David</hi> begs in the Pſalm of my Text, in order to his comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble going hence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>God would take away his tranſgreſſions,</hi> Pſal. 39.8. As long as there is any ſin, any guilt lying upon our Conſciences, any ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, any difference between God and us, any frowns in his face towards us, we are unready for death, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with that comfort and boldneſs of ſpirit, welcom it as we ought; but when our peace with God is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we have a renewed ſenſe of his pardoning love in our ſouls, then are things right, and in order with us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41049:73"/>deed; and we may think of death with boldneſs and comfort, and therefore mind this, as ever you would be found ready for a dying hour; every day even things between God and you, every day get a freſh ſenſe of pardon from him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as near as poſſible may be, do nothing that may occaſion any breach between God and you, or raiſe any frowns in his face towards you: if you do not break with God, he will not break with you; all breaches, as to peace and friendſhip between God and us, begin on our part; yea, neither will God break with us for little things, in caſe they be not allowed by us, but watched and ſtriven againſt; therefore, as near as poſſibly you can, do nothing to break and interrupt your peace with God for one moment: And becauſe when you have done all, many things may and will fall out (we having ſinful ſinning hearts, and living in a world of ſnares and temptations) for which God may juſtly frown upon us; let us</p>
               <p>Secondly, every day make even with him: in the cloſe of every day let us
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41049:73"/>conſider wherein we have broken with God, come ſhort of duty, given any grief, any diſtaſte to his Holy Spirit; and by Faith and Prayer let us ſue out the pardon of it; and let us not lie down, if poſſible, without ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his pardoning love: for which end,</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſhould act Faith on the Blood and Advocateſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through faith in his Blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Rom. 3.24, 25. And indeed, Chriſt hath ſet up a Standing Office in Heaven, which we may call the Pardon-Office; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth new Pardons for his People daily under their new ſins; <hi>We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. Have daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Blood of Chriſt; truly without it there is no living; the beſt, the holieſt on earth, have daily need of his Blood, and ſhould have daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto it, for the maintaining of their peace, and for the renewing of Gods pardoning love in their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhould be humbly and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41049:74"/>earneſtly importunate with God in prayer, reſolving not to let him go without this bleſſing, carrying upon our ſpirits the ſenſe of the worth, and alſo of our unworthineſs of it. Thus the holy men of God of old have done, they have ſued out the pardon of their ſins by Faith and Prayer, and gotten a freſh ſenſe of Gods love when they have broken with him; as I might inſtance in <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> and others; we ſhould every day pray as that Father did, <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do not after the manner of a Judge weigh or conſider what I have done, what I have ſpoken, what I have thought, but blot out all my ſins with thy own Blood:</hi> And as another of them did, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is that in me which may offend thy holy eyes, I know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it; but who ſhall cleanſe me? or to whom ſhall I fly for relief, but to thee? O hide not thy face from me.</hi> Truly when we have walked moſt watchfully, moſt circumſpectly, many things may, and will fall out, that may offend the pure eyes of Gods Glory, which we ſhould confeſs and bewail before him, ſuing out the pardon of them by the Blood of his Son. Some of the Saints have made
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41049:74"/>this their daily practiſe, and ſo have maintained their peace for many years together; and when they have come to die, have gloricuſly triumphed over Death; and have gone off the Stage with much comfort; and ſo ſhould we.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Would you indeed have all right; all in order in your ſouls for a dying hour? then be true and faithful to your own Conſciences; that you may have them for you, and not againſt you, both while you live, and when you die. Conſcience (my Beloved) is Chriſts De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, or Vicegerent in the Soul, it is both a Judge and a Witneſs for God within us, it either <hi>accuſes, or excuſes,</hi> acquits, or condemns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. and according as Conſcience is either for us, or againſt us, ſo we are either ready, or not ready, prepared, or not prepared, for Death and Judgment: If we have the Witneſs and Judgment of our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for us, then have we boldneſs and comfort both in life and death, then we can welcom Deaths approach to us, but if the Witneſs and Judgment of Conſcience be againſt us, then Death cannot but be terrible to us, <hi>This is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41049:75"/>our rejoycing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our Conſciences, that in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. And again, <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things; but if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21. O, my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as a peace with God, ſo a ſound and holy peace with a mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (that is to ſay, to have the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judgment of a mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for him, and not againſt him) is highly requiſite for a right diſpoſing and preparing of us for a dying hour: As ever therefore you would have all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in order againſt ſuch an hour, mind this, and look after this; be ſure you carry it ſo to your own conſciences, as that you may have them always for you, and not againſt you, while you live; and for you, and not againſt you, when you come to die: In order to which, mind theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Labour to get your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces well inlightned and informed, and be much with God in prayer in order
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41049:75"/>thereto; beg and implore God for a true and faithful Conſcience, a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that will bear a true and faithful witneſs in your ſouls, and that will paſs a right judgment upon things, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſtate and actions. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.21. we read of <hi>a true heart,</hi> or a true conſcience, that is, a conſcience rightly informed, a conſcience that bears a true and faithful witneſs, and that paſſeth a true and faithful judgment upon things, ſuch a conſcience ſhould we beg of God, and labour by all means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attain unto. O, my Beloved, it is a dangerous thing to have an erroneous conſcience, a miſtaking conſcience, a conſcience not rightly inform'd: For pray mark, this is what leaves a man under a neceſſity of ſinning, and ſo of grieving the Spirit of God on the one hand, and it endangereth his peace and comfort on the other hand: for having an erroneous conſcience, whether we obey it, or obey it not, we ſin; if we obey it, we ſin, becauſe conſcience commands what is not agreeable to the Word of God; if we obey it not, we ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we rebell againſt the light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Conſcience, omitting that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41049:76"/>which Conſcience tells us is a duty, though it be not a duty, or doing that which Conſcience tells us is a ſin, though it be not a ſin: Labour therefore to get your Conſciences well informed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Be ſure you do nothing againſt the light and dictates of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being rightly informed, but obey it in all things. In <hi>Job</hi> 24.13. we read of ſome that <hi>rebel againſt the light,</hi> that is, that do ſin againſt their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with is a double ſin, a ſin cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with great aggravations, and greatly diſcompoſeth us for a dying hour: but we muſt take heed of this and liſten to the voice of Conſcience, Conſcience regulated by the word of God: God ſpeaks to us by our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he ſpeaks to us through his word by our Conſciences, and he ſpeak to us through his providences by our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and we ſhould take heed of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Dictates, or ſpeaking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the leaſt. Doth not Conſcience many times tell us, ſuch as ſuch ways which we walk in are not good, and muſt be turned from, or we are undone for ever? And now we ſhould be true
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41049:76"/>and faithful to our own Conſciences, and ſpeedily turn from thoſe ways, we ſhould have nothing to do with any thing that Conſcience condemns us in and for. Again, Doth not Conſcience many times tell you, that ſuch and ſuch duties are totally neglected, or elſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or ſlightly performed by you, which yet you ought to be converſant and diligent in the performance of? Now you ſhould herein alſo be faithful and true to your own Conſciences, living up to the conſtant, diligent, ſpiritual performance of thoſe duties. Again, Doth not Conſcience many times tell you, that things are nor right with you, that it is an evil frame of ſpirit you live in, that you are too carnal, too light, too vain, too frothy, too eager in your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of this World, and too remiſs in your purſuits of Heaven and Eternity? Now as ever you would be ready for a dying hour, you ſhould be faithful to your own Conſciences, ſetting that right which is amiſs, and haſtening out of that evil frame, into the contrary gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious frame. (Oh my Beloved) if you be true and faithful to Conſcience, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be true and faithful to you;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41049:77"/>witneſſing for you, and not againſt you, both while you live, and when you die. In a word, in all things labour to keep a good conſcience; this was <hi>Paul</hi>'s great care and exerciſe, Acts 24.16. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have always a conſcience void of offence towards God, and towards man.</hi> O this will be a ſweet and bleſſed exerciſe, and the more we are found in it while we live, the more comfort will it afford us when we come to die.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Would you indeed have all things right, and in order in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of your ſouls, when a dying hour comes? Then labour for much purity of heart and life, and by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any ſin, any corruption whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; the more pure and holy we are, the more ready are we, and in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſture things are with us for a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour: <hi>Without holineſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Holineſs is neceſſary unto happineſs; holineſs is the way unto happineſs; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is what ſits and prepares us for happineſs, and brings us unto happineſs; yea, holineſs is a part of our happineſs, a great part of the happineſs of Heaven it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41049:77"/>ſelf lies in holineſs; accordingly the more holy we are, the more we are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and prepared for the future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and ſo for Death and Judgment; for that which prepares us for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, that alſo prepares us for death, which is but an in-let into that happineſs for ever: Therefore, if you would have all things right, all things ready indeed for a dying hour, then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the exacteſt purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that poſſibly you can: This is that which the Apoſtle aims at, and prays for, on the behalf of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as moſt conducing to the preparing of them for their latter end, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>And the Lord make you to abound and increaſe in love one towards another, and towards all men, even as we do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, to the end he may eſtabliſh your hearts unblamable in holineſs before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all his Saints.</hi> The poſture he would have them to be in at the coming of Chriſt, is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of unblamable holineſs, which indeed is the beſt and readieſt poſture: The ſame thing he prays for, in order to the ſame end, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>And the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41049:78"/>very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body be preſerved blameleſs unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is that alſo which that other Apoſtle injoyns in order hereunto, 2 Pet. 3.14. <hi>Be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs;</hi> the more ſpotleſs and blameleſs we are in our ſpirits and ways, the more ready we are for Death and Judgment: O preſs after an eminency in holineſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of none, no not the leaſt taint or tincture of ſin, or ſinful defilement, upon any terms whatſoever: unholy ſouls are unready ſouls, they are unready for Death, unready for Judgment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for the future life: and for men to talk of being ready for theſe, and yet be unholy, is the greateſt folly in the world: therefore labour for much puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and holineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Labour for much purity and holineſs in your lives and walkings: this is what God indiſpenſably calls for, 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> We ſhould preſs
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41049:78"/>after univerſal holineſs: there ſhould be a vein and tincture of holineſs run through all we do, even our Civil, as well as our Religious actions, we ſhould as near as poſſibly be dedicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God, and our Lives ſhould be lives of walking with him: they, and they onely, who walk with God while they live, are thoſe who will be found ready to live with God, when they come to die: As for all careleſs, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ones, let them never talk of being ready for death, and the future life; for they are at an utter diſtance from any ſuch thing: indeed ready they are; but for what? ready for Hell, ready for the wrath of God, ready for deſtruction; but they are not at all ready for a bleſſed Eternity: The Apoſtle weeps over ſuch, as being indeed thus ready, Phil. 3.18, 19. <hi>Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Many there are who profeſs and hope well of themſelves, as to another life, who yet are looſe and carnal, wicked and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41049:79"/>in their lives and walkings: they do not watch and keep their garments, but wallow in the mire of their luſts and pollutions: they ſtain their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with foul, groſs, and ſcandalous ſins; at leaſt they live and allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome ſecret way and haunt of ſinning, indulging this and the other Luſt: But (my Beloved) theſe are far indeed from being ready for a dying hour; and muſt expect to be caſt off from God and Chriſt for ever: Such were thoſe, Mat. 7.22, 23. <hi>They came, and cried Lord, Lord:</hi> came with their gifts, parts, and privileges; but Chriſt ſent them away, with a <hi>depart from me, ye workers of iniquity:</hi> So in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>and beginning,</hi> we read of ſome that made profeſſion of God and his ways, and yet walked in ſin, and wallowed in all manner of abomination: And what is the iſſue? Verſe the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will caſt you out of my ſight.</hi> God will at laſt caſt off all looſe, licentious walkers. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.9. <hi>David</hi> prays thus, <hi>Gather not my ſoul with ſinners:</hi> And truly, if you would not be gathered with ſinners at laſt, you muſt not walk in ſin with ſiners now: and as for the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41049:79"/>Saints themſelves, ſo far as they let down their watch, and neglect their walking with God; ſo far as they give way to a looſe, vain, heedleſs way of living, ſo far they have things out of order with them, and they are unready for a dying hour: <hi>Behold, I come as a Thief,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his Garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame,</hi> Rev. 16.15. So far as the Saints carry it unbecoming their high and holy Profeſſion (which is too too frequent with them) ſo far they are ſhort of that compleat readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Death and Eternity they ſhould preſs after.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Labour for much purity and holineſs in your hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we muſt be pure and holy within, as well as without; in our hearts and affctions, as well as in our lives and walkings, if we would have all right indeed for a dying hour; <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord? and who ſhall ſtand in his holy place?</hi> The anſwer is, <hi>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart,</hi> Pſal. 24.3, 4. And Chriſt expreſly tells us, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. Indeed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41049:80"/>impure hearts are unfit to ſee God; he is a pure and holy God; nor may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure-hearted ones expect that bleſſed ſight. I remember a ſaying which I have read in one of the Ancients, (which I look upon to be a great ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>Woe and alas, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how prepoſterous is it? how raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed? how inordinate? how remote from the rule of the Word of thy Truth and Wiſdom, for a man to deſire to ſee God with an unclean heart?</hi> Oh have a watchful eye upon your hearts, and labour to keep them as free from any taint and tincture of ſin as poſſibly you can?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Be ſure you ſuffer no luſt to get up into the Throne, where it is too too often found. When ſin is conſented to by the Will, the luſt is on the Throne in the heart: and indeed it is wonderful to think how ſoon one or another cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption will mount up into the Throne in the Soul, if we let down our Watch but a little: But oh take heed of this! ſo far as any one luſt whatſoever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant within us, ſo far we are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous unready for a dying hour: And not onely ſo; but,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:41049:80"/>
Secondly, Watch narrowly againſt the very firſt riſings and motions of ſin within: Nip Luſt, if poſſible, in the very Bud and Bloſſom: It is true, this calls upon us to have a very curious eye upon our hearts, and indeed ſuch an eye we ſhould have upon them, we muſt have upon them, if we mean to be Chriſtians indeed: Grace will teach a man not onely to oppoſe the acts of ſin, and to watch againſt the reign of any heart-luſt; but alſo to oppoſe the very firſt motions and riſings of ſin in the Soul: And the more you do this, the better poſture you are in for a dying hour.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, WOuld you indeed have all ready, and in order in your ſouls for a dying hour? Then
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41049:81"/>reſt not in low and ordinary, but aſpire after the higheſt and nobleſt ſtrains of Grace. The better to underſtand this, you muſt know, that there are ſome higher and more noble ſtrains of Grace than ordinary, ſtrains of Grace that carry a peculiar glory and excellency in them, and do in an eminent manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the heart of God, indeed every ſtrain of Grace, even the leaſt and loweſt, has a beauty and glory in it, and is a pleaſure to Gods heart: the leaſt dram of godly ſorrow, the leaſt holy awe of God, and trembling at his Word, the leaſt breathing of love and deſire towards him, the leaſt leaning upon him, in a way of hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance; Oh it has a great glory in it, and is a delight to Gods Soul: <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy, Pſal.</hi> 147.11. But, my Beloved, there are ſome more choice and eminent ſtrains and actings of Grace, that are above the ordinary rate, and do pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly delight the heart of God, and bring honour to him; and the more you come up to theſe, and live under the power of theſe, the more ready
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41049:81"/>poſture you are in for a dying hour. Grace is the beginning of Glory: 'Tis (as a worthy Divine expreſſes it) <hi>the infancy of Heaven and Glory;</hi> and the higher it riſes in us, the nearer it comes to Glory, and the more it fits us for it: therefore, I ſay, reſt not in low and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but covet and preſs after the higheſt and nobleſt ſtrains of Grace, ſome of which I ſhall here ſet down, and inſiſt a little upon, in order to this great end of being found under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt readineſs for a dying hour: The noble ſtrains of Grace I would have you come up unto, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a man to be high, and yet low; high in worth and attainments, but low in ſpirit, low in his own thoughts and apprehenſions of himſelf, to be humble under high and great acquirements, this is noble Grace. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> — That he <hi>was high in worth, but low in ſpirit:</hi> he had great attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but was very humble and lowly under all, which is mentioned as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excellency in him: and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a ſaying which I have read in one of the Ancients, ſpeaking of Hamility;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41049:82"/>
                  <hi>For a man to be humble</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in a low, deſpicable, abject condition, this is no great matter, but honourable humility;</hi> that is to ſay, for a man to be humble in an high and proſperous condition, to be humble under eminent enjoyments, <hi>this is a great thing, a rare vertue indeed.</hi> Oh for a man to be high in attainments, high in gifts, high in graces, high in comforts, high in ſervices, high in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, high in place and eſteem among men; and yet at the ſame time to be low in mind, low in heart, low in his eſteems and apprehenſions of himſelf, this is an high and eminent ſtrain of Grace: this <hi>Paul</hi> excelled in, and 'twas his Crown and Glory: he was a man of as high attainments and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as moſt that ever lived; he was high in gifts, high in graces, high in comforts, high in ſervices, high in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, high in all true worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and yet how low, how humble in ſpirit was he? how little in his own eyes, and how vile in his own eſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You know how he ſpeaks of himſelf <hi>The chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, not worthy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41049:82"/>to be called an Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.9. <hi>I am nothing,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.11. This alſo was a part of Chriſts Crown and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: who ever ſo eminent in gifts and graces? who ever abounded with ſuch glorious endowments as he? and yet who ſo meek, ſo humble, ſo lowly, as he? <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for I am meek and lowly of heart,</hi> Mat. 11.29. In a verſe or two before he had told us, that <hi>all things were delivered to him by the Father;</hi> and yet here, <hi>I am meek and lowly in heart:</hi> He was humble under all his advancements and attainments; Oh labour to be like him herein; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your attainments are, labour to be humble under them, and that becauſe he was ſo: <hi>Bluſh, O duſt and aſhes, bluſh to think of being proud, be aſhamed to be proud: God humbles himſelf, and doſt thou exalt thy ſelf?</hi> ſo one ſpeaks. And again elſewhere, <hi>'Tis intolerable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that when Majeſty empties and humbles it ſelf, a vile worm ſhould ſwell, and be blown up with pride.</hi> O be humble, whatever your attainments are; the more humble you are, the more precious you are in Gods ſight, for <hi>he hath reſpect unto the lowly, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41049:83"/>the proud afar off,</hi> Pſal. 138.6. yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>he reſiſteth the proud,</hi> he ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in battel array againſt the proud, Jam. 4.6. <hi>Arrogate nothing to thy ſelf of thoſe things that are in thee, but thy ſins, by ſo much the more precious thou art in Gods eyes, by how much the more vile and deſpicable thou art in thy own eyes,</hi> ſays <hi>Bernard.</hi> And to ſay no more, none more ready to die, than the humble and lowly perſon; none more unready than the proud and high-minded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For a man to be full, and yet emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; full of the enjoyments, and yet emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the love of the world: for a man to enjoy an affluence of this worlds good, a fulneſs of all creature comforts and contentments, and yet to be dead to all, and fit looſe from all, placing his whole happineſs in God and Chriſt, this is a choice, a noble, an excellent ſtrain of Grace indeed. We read of ſome, and but of ſome, in Scripture, who under an affluence of outward enjoyments have been weaned from all, and ſate looſe from all, and have kept up their communion with God, placing the whole reſt and happineſs of their Souls therein; ſome ſuch (I ſay) we read of in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41049:83"/>Scripture, but truly there are but very few, and indeed 'tis both a rare and a difficult thing for a ſoul thus to do: Theſe things eſpecially, when enjoyed in the fulneſs of them, are ſo apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the heart to themſelves, and to alienate it from God, and communion with God, that 'tis indeed a very rare and difficult thing for a man under an affluence of them, to fit looſe from them, and make God, and communion with God, all in all to him. 'Tis a great ſaying which I have read of a learned man, <hi>Although adverſity breaks many, yet proſperity, and a fulneſs of enjoyments, kills many more: And how rare a man is that, who in proſperity does not, at leaſt a little, in ſome degree or other, let down his Watch, and remit his ſtrictneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in walking.</hi> David <hi>was a wiſe man, and</hi> Solomon <hi>was a wiſer; and yet both the one and the other diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered great ſin and folly through abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſperity:</hi> So that I ſay, 'tis both a rare and difficult thing; but by how much the more rare and difficult it is, by ſo much the more excellent and eminent, when attained. Oh for a man to ſwim Chin-deep in the ſtreams of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41049:84"/>creature-comforts, and yet not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Fountain of living waters; for a man to have the ſtreams run pleaſantly on each hand of him, and yet to bathe and delight onely in the Fountain, as his reſt and happineſs; for a man in the height of proſperity to be able to ſay to God, as the Pſalmiſt in his affliction did, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and there is none upon earth I deſire beſides thee;</hi> this is noble Grace indeed: O labour to come up to this, whatever your worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, though never ſo great, ſo high, ſo pleaſant; yet as ever you would be ready for a dying hour, fit looſe from all, die to all; the more dead we are to the world, the more ready we are to go out of the world: a worldly ſpirit, a ſpirit in love with this world, is moſt unready for a dying hour; how can he be ready to leave the world, that is in love with the world? a worldly ſpirit is moſt odious to the Spirit of God, and moſt unſuitable to the future life; and one living in that ſpirit cannot be fit to die. 'Tis a great ſaying I have read in one, <hi>He is perfect whoſe ſoul is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the world; but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41049:84"/>ſoul is far from God, to whom this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life is ſweet:</hi> that is to fay, who is fond of theſe poor things here. O die, die daily to the world under all your enjoyments of it, if you would indeed be ready to die.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For a man to be empty, and yet full; to be deſtitute of all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and enjoyments, and yet to want nothing, but to be content, and to ſee all in God, and enjoy all in God; for a man to be afflicted, and diſtreſs'd, and yet at the ſame time ſee a fulneſs and ſufficiency of all good and happineſs in a naked God, and naked Godlineſs, and accordingly to live upon him, and reſt ſatisfied in him; this is a noble ſtrain of Grace indeed; this the Prophet, and in him the Church reſolved upon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Athough the fig tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls.</hi> Here you ſee is a moſt ſad ſuppoſition, a moſt forlorn and deſtitute condition ſuppoſed to come; well, and what then? in caſe all this comes to paſs, what will the Church do
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41049:85"/>then? that the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> tells us, <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation:</hi> ſhe is reſolved to live upon God, and delight her ſelf with God; ſhe ſees enough in him alone, and ſets him, and her intereſt in him, over againſt all wants, loſſes, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. who were <hi>as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things:</hi> they ſaw all in Chriſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all in Chriſt. <hi>Here</hi> (as one gloſſes upon the place) <hi>we poſſeſs nothing, but do wander up and down from place to place: yet poſſeſſing Chriſt, in him we poſſeſs all things.</hi> Oh for a man to ſee and enjoy all in Chriſt, when the world frowns upon him, and is low with him, this is a noble ſtrain of Grace; and let me ſay this, that 'tis an argument that we have carnal hearts, if we ſee not all in God, and enough in God to ſatisfie us, and make us happy, whether we have any thing or nothing of this worlds: Heaven, which death ſends us to, if we are indeed ready for it, is no thing elſe but the viſion and fruition of God, for there he is all in all: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we do not ſee all in God now, and enough in God now, we cannot
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41049:85"/>ſuppoſe our ſelves to be ſo fully ready for death and Eternity, as we ought to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For a man to have no affliction, and yet to be deeply afflicted, to be wholly free from all perſonal affliction, and yet greatly to lay to heart, and be afflicted for the afflictions of Gods name and people, this is glorious Grace, Grace in luſtre. 'Tis the obſervation of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divine, That in the day of the Churches trouble and affliction, when both his name and people do greatly ſuffer, God does ſometimes leave ſome of his people an affluence of all outward good things; when others are ſtript of all their comforts, they are full; when others are in ſtraights, they abound; neither is there any cloud upon their Tabernacle: and this God does to try them, whether they will take up in their enjoyments, and forget the afflictions of his name and people; and truly not to do ſo, but in ſuch a caſe to lay the Churches afflictions to heart, and to bleed and mourn with the bleeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Gods name and people, this is pure Grace, and marvellous pleaſing to God: ſuch Grace ſome of the Saints
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41049:86"/>have come up unto; ſuch Grace was ſound in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.1, 2. <hi>And it came to paſs, when the King ſate in his houſe, and the Lord had given him reſt round about from all enemies, that the King ſaid unto</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet, See now, I dwell in an houſe of Cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within Curtains.</hi> Mark, all was well with <hi>David,</hi> he had reſt, and he dwelt in an Houſe of Cedar, he had all things ſuitable for and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a King: ah, but all was not well with the intereſt of God and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>Davids</hi> houſe and intereſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered; but it fared not ſo well with the houſe and intereſt of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his enjoyments were as nothing to him, he ſo laid the ſufferings of Gods name and worſhip to heart. The like was found in <hi>Nehemiah, Neh. begin.</hi> all things were well with him in his own perſon, he was the Kings Cup-bearer, and lived under the enjoyment of an affluence of all outward contentments; and yet was in deep affliction of ſpirit, upon the account of the Churches affliction: <hi>When I heard theſe words,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>verſe</hi> 4. theſe words! what words? why that <hi>the remnant that were
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41049:86"/>left of the Captivity were in great affliction and reproach, that the wall of Jeruſalem was broken down, and that the gates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were burnt with fire.</hi> So <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>Now when I heard theſe words, I ſate down and wept, and mourned certain days, and faſted and prayed before the God of heaven,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>beg. his countenance,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>was ſad</hi> upon this account. Oh this vvas rare Grace, choice Grace! no perſonal affliction, yet deeply afflicted in and vvith the afflictions of the Church; ſo deeply afflicted, that all his perſonal comforts, though great, were nothing to him. The like you find in <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 10.2, 3. Oh labour to come up to this ſtrain of Grace: it may be things are well with you, and you have all that heart can wiſh; but if they are not ſo vvith the intereſt of Gods name and people, you ſhould be deeply afflicted for this in the midſt of all your perſonal comforts; and the more of this ſpirit is in you, the more excellent your Grace is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For a man chearfully to ſubmit to, and acquieſce in the vvill of God, when moſt ſharp and ſevere upon his outward intereſt, this is a noble ſtrain of Grace.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41049:87"/>When God ſhall exerciſe a man with rending, tearing diſpenſations, adding ſorrow to ſorrow to him, breaking him with breach upon breach, cauſing all his waves and his billows to go over him; and yet then for him quietly to acquieſce in, and chearfully to ſubmit to what God does, this is choice Grace: ſuch Grace was found in <hi>Aaron, Lev.</hi> 10.3. God ſlew two of his Sons at once, and the dipenſation was attended with ſo many aggravating circumſtances, as made it almoſt unparallell'd, not to be equall'd, ſo terrible was it; and yet under that great ſtroke, <hi>Aaron held his peace,</hi> he ſubmitted freely, and acquieſced chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: the like was found in <hi>Job,</hi> when God had broken him all to pieces, he worſhips him, and bleſſes his name, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21, 22. and this was eminent in Chriſt himſelf, and was indeed his crown and glory; <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> Mat. 26.39. he freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his will to the Fathers, though he ſaw the Father coming forth againſt him in a moſt terrible diſpenſation. O for a poor ſoul to lie down at the foot of God, and to be ſo melted into his will, as chearfully to bow to it, and acquieſce
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41049:87"/>in it under the ſharpeſt diſpenſations; this is noble Grace indeed. Oh preſs after this, this is very neceſſary to prepare us for a dying hour, and the more of this, the more ready for that hour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For a man to maintain the actings of his Faith in God, and to think ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of him, when yet he frowns, and all things ſeem to make againſt the ſoul, this is a noble ſtrain of Grace. Such Grace was found in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who, 'tis ſaid, <hi>againſt hope, believed in hope,</hi> and ſo <hi>was ſtrong in faith,</hi> Rom. 4.18, 19, 20. when he had no encouragement, yea when all things oppoſed him, yet then he maintained his faith in God. So <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 13.15. <hi>though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> O to love a ſmiting God, and to truſt in a ſlaying God, this is noble Grace, for a man to maintain the actings of his Faith in God, when he comes forth as an enemy againſt him; this God calls for, he expects that <hi>when we walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light, then we ſhould truſt in the name of the Lord;</hi> and ſo to do is noble Grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10, 11. truly 'tis oftentimes the caſe of Gods people, that they walk in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41049:88"/>darkneſs, and ſee no light, all things ſeem to be againſt them. Poſſibly God frowns and afflicts; he frowns within, and he afflicts without: <q>yea, the poor ſoul ſees nothing but difficulties and diſcouragements, look which way he will: he looks into his own heart, and there he cannot find any one grace or gracious diſpoſition; he looks into the Word, and there perhaps he can't ſee any one Promiſe that he dares lay hold upon; he looks back for former experiences, and they are all out of ſight; he runs to his evidences, and they are all blotted that he can't read them.</q> Thus he is beſet vvith difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all things ſeem to make againſt him both vvithin and vvithout; and yet now, vvhen thus in the dark, for the ſoul to believe in God, and think vvell and honourably of him, this is noble Grace indeed, this is Faith in luſtre: to call Chriſt Lord, vvhen he calls us Dog, and to faſten by Faith upon him, vvhen he is beating us off, as to ſenſe at leaſt, as 'twas with the vvoman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.26, 27, 28. this is glorious Grace: for a man to think vvell, and hope vvell, and believe vvell, in the face of frowns and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41049:88"/>diſcouragements; for a man, when God is frowning and ſmiting, cordially to ſay, This is but for a time, he will ſmile again, he is but behind the Curtain, and will appear again; his deſire is not to ruine me, but refine me; he is but making me to prize his Grace and preſence more; there is love in all this: O for a man to believe that there is love in Gods heart, when he ſees nothing but frowns in his face, and meets with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hardly but blows from his hand; for a man to believe that God intends nothing but good, when he inflicts va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of evils, ſurely this is glorious Grace: O that you would labour for ſuch Grace! ſuch Grace will look death in the face with boldneſs. 'Tis a great ſpeech which holy <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath, <hi>I lay inhibitions on my thoughts</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that they receive no ſlanders of my onely, onely beloved: let him even ſay out of his own mouth, there is no hope, yet I will die in that ſweet beguile, it is not ſo: but I ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, it is my joy to believe under the water, and to die with faith in my hand griping of Chriſt.</hi> Beg ſuch Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For a man to ſee a beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41049:89"/>in ſervice as well as in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in work as well as in reward, and accordingly to have his heart lie in it, this alſo is noble Grace. Sirs, there is a beauty and excellency in ſervice for a man to be uſed and employ'd for God, and to act for him in the world, is the higheſt honour and excellency (next to union and communion with him) that can be put upon a poor creature: 'twas the honour of Chriſt, it is the honour of Angels: ſervice is better than enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>'tis a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive,</hi> Acts 20.35. now when a ſoul has anſwerable thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions about it, does practically, and indeed, ſee a beauty and excellency in ſervice for God, and accordingly is active for him, willing to be employed by him, and that though he has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at preſent from him; this is noble Grace. This was found in <hi>Paul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is this grace given to preach unto the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. he look'd on't as an honour, a favour to be employ'd in the work and ſervice of Chriſt. And again, 1 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for what he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41049:89"/>accounted me faithful, putting me into the Miniſtry.</hi> Here he bleſſes Chriſt his Lord and Maſter, for uſing of him in his work; yea, ſuch a worth, beauty, and excellency did he ſee in his ſervice, that he was content to ſtay out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the boſom of Chriſts love, where yet he earneſtly longed to be, that he might do further ſervice for Chriſt in this world. So you find <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21, 22.23. O for a ſoul to long, and long ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for Heaven, and the immediate enjoyment of Chriſt there, and yet to be content to ſtay here in a ſinful, ſinning, troubleſom world, meerly to do ſome further ſervice for Chriſt, and to honour him yet in the diſcharge of his Work and Warfare, this is high Grace, this holy <hi>Rutherford</hi> had attained unto, he could under high aſſurances of Heaven be content to ſtay many years out of it, to preach Chriſt. The ſame mind dwelt in Chriſt himſelf, who <hi>went about doing good, making it his meat and drink to do his Fathers will, and to finiſh his work:</hi> Oh when a ſoul comes to this, then he is fit to live, and fit to die; when with that Ancient Father we come to ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>What is it to live, and not to live
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41049:90"/>for uſe and ſervice?</hi> when we value life and days in the world, no further than we are ſome way ſerviceable to Chriſt, this is crowning Grace.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For a man to rejoyce in the gifts, graces, and uſes of others, and that though they out-ſhine and eclipſe his; for a man to rejoyce to ſee Grace flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in others, and to ſee the work of God carried on by others, though he himſelf be laid aſide, and does not ſhare in the honour of it, this is pure Grace, Grace in luſtre: ſuch Grace was found in <hi>Moſes, Envieſt thou for my ſake?</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who would have had him to forbid <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> to propheſie in the Camp) <hi>would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his ſpirit upon them,</hi> Num. 11.29. he was ſo far from envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them, that he wiſhes there were more of them: Such Grace was found alſo in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> Joh. 3.26, 27, 30. he rejoyced in Chriſts being owned, and honoured, and flock'd unto, and in the increaſe of his eſteem with men, though to his own abaſement. In <hi>verſe</hi> 26. ſome of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples come and tell him, that <hi>all men come to Chriſt;</hi> well, ſays
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41049:90"/>he, 'tis but his due, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>A man can receive nothing, unleſs it be given him from heaven: you your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt; and this my joy is fulfilled, that he muſt increaſe, and I muſt decreaſe:</hi> as if he had ſaid, 'Tis ſo far from being a trouble to me, that 'tis indeed the compleating of my joy: Such Grace was found in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.18. who rejoyced that Chriſt was preach'd, though with a deſign to cloud and eclipſe him; <hi>Chriſt is preach'd, and I therein do rejoyce, yea and will rejoyce.</hi> Some are apt to think 'twill be an affliction to me (ſays he) that Chriſt is preach'd by any but my ſelf; whereas indeed this is ground of great joy to me; I rejoyce that though I cannot be permitted to preach Chriſt my ſelf, yet that ſo many others do preach him. And I remember a great ſpeech of <hi>Luther</hi> (arguing the ſame Grace to be in him) writing to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon,</hi> to comfort him under the lets and oppoſition the work and cauſe of God met withal in his time; the cauſe of God was oppoſed, and his Work ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, in the ſenſe of which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> was greatly troubled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41049:91"/>and <hi>Luther</hi> underſtanding it, writes an Epiſtle to him, to comfort and encourage him, in which he has this ſaying; <hi>God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is able to raiſe the dead, and he is able to ſupport his fallen cauſe, and to raiſe it when fallen; If he ſhall not account us worthy to be uſed therein, let him do it by others, and make uſe of others.</hi> Mark, he was content the work of God ſhould be done by others. There are two things which I look upon to carry as pure and noble Grace in them, as any whatever: one is, to be willing to be uſed in Gods work, without being taken notice of, or having the honour of it: the other is, for a man to rejoyce to ſee the work of God carried on by others, though he himſelf be laid aſide, and has not the honour of being uſed therein. Oh la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſuch Grace, Grace that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Gifts, Graces, Uſes, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of others, though you thereby are out-ſhined.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For a man to have great affection to the name and honour of God and Chriſt, and to think nothing too much to do, too hard to ſuffer, or too dear to part withal for the ſervice and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41049:91"/>thereof, this is noble Grace: when a man has high and paramount affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the name of God and Chriſt, loving and preferring of it infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his own intereſts and concerns, being ready to be, do, or ſuffer any thing for the ſervice on't: Oh what Grace is this! ſuch Grace ſome of the Saints have attained to. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſays <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi>) <hi>if thou wilt, forgive their ſin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the Book which thou haſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> Exod. 32.32. What is here meant by the Book which God has written, I ſhall not now ſtand to enquire or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but to be content to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out on't, was to be ſure a great piece of ſelf denial; and this <hi>Moſes</hi> was, you ſee, rather than that the people ſhould be utterly deſtroyed; and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew how much the glory of God was concerned, and would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by their deſtruction, as appears by comparing this <hi>verſe</hi> with <hi>verſe</hi> 12. the ſum (as one obſerves) is, That <hi>Moſes prefers the glory of God before his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whoſe glory was conjoyned with</hi> Iſraels <hi>preſervation, in reſpect of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to the Fathers, and in reſpect
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41049:92"/>of the Blaſphemies which the</hi> Egyptians <hi>and other adverſaries were ready to belch out againſt God, ſhould he deſtroy them:</hi> Such Grace was found alſo in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in the place lately mentioned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>latter end,</hi> who was content Chriſt ſhould raiſe himſelf out of his abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſuch Grace was found in Chriſt, who preferred his Fathers glory before his own life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27, 28. ſuch Grace was found in <hi>Paul,</hi> who was <hi>willing not onely to be bound, but even to die for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 21.13. for the Name, the honour of Chriſt: Chriſts honour was ſo dear to him, that he could be content to die to ſerve it, he preferr'd it before his life: O, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, when a ſoul ſhall be ſo ſwallowed up with love and zeal to the glory of God, and the intereſt of Chriſt in the world, as that his own intereſts are in a manner overlook'd and forgotten by him; when to ſee the Name of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, ſhall be a mans greateſt triumph; and to ſee it debaſed, ſhall be his greateſt trouble; when his practical language ſhall be ſuch as this; Father, here I am, which way ſo ever thy glory lies, I am ready to ſerve thee in it, 'tis honour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41049:92"/>enough for me to honour God, 'tis hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs enough for me to glorifie God; and therefore let God do with me, and let him call me to do whatever he will in order thereunto: let him if he pleaſes eclipſe my name, and throw my glory in the duſt; ſo be it: he will thereby raiſe his own Name, and brighten his own Glory: let him, if he pleaſes, make me a footſtool, and let me be trampled upon, ſo be it; he will advance himſelf into the Throne thereby; let me die, if his will be ſo, that his glory may live; whatever becomes of me, though I ſhould be ſtript of all, though my name and intereſt ſhould rot, yet let God be magnified, let God have honour in the world, and let the intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt proſper, 'tis enough, I am ſatisfied: When, I ſay, 'tis thus with a ſoul, this ſpeaks noble Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Oh preſs after ſuch Grace; the more you love the Name of God and Chriſt, the fitter you are either to live or die.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For a man not onely to be willing to ſuffer, but alſo to rejoyce in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the ſake of Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for a man chearfully to take up the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41049:93"/>Croſs for Chriſt, and to look upon it as his crown and glory, as an honour and preferment to him, this alſo is an high ſtrain of Grace, and is greatly pleaſing to God. The Croſs, my Beloved, in it ſelf <hi>is a black ſowre Crab-tree,</hi> (as one calls it) but, though ſuch in it ſelf, yet as 'tis born for the ſake of Chriſt, and ſo his Croſs, 'tis an honour, and not a reproach, a Crown of Glory, a Royal Diadem upon the head of a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>To you is given on the behalf of Chriſt, to ſuffer for his ſake,</hi> Phil. 1.29. Sufferings for Chriſt are a Noble, Royal, Honourable gift, more Honourable than the Crowns and Kingdoms of this world: a priſon for Chriſt, is more honourable than the ſtatelieſt Palaces of the greateſt Princes: bonds for Chriſt, are more honourable than ropes of Pearl or Diamonds. Now when a ſoul ſhall look on theſe things as ſuch, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rejoyce in them, this is noble Grace indeed: ſuch Grace was found in the Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>who rejoyced</hi> (or, as the word is, <hi>leapt for joy</hi>) <hi>that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt;</hi> or, as the words may be rendred, that they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41049:93"/>to be diſhonour'd for Chriſt. So the Apoſtle and his Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We glory in tribulation;</hi> and, <hi>I rejoyce</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>in reproaches, neceſſities, and perſecutions for Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. So thoſe Worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. who <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods.</hi> This Chriſt calls for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, when men perſecute you for my ſake.</hi> And again, <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into divers afflictions, &amp;c. James</hi> 1.12. 'Tis admirable to think how ſome of the Saints, both in former and latter times, have gloried in the Croſs of Chriſt, and even longed for it. <hi>Luther</hi> longed for the honour of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryrdom, and was ready even to envy thoſe that were called to it, when he was not; writing to ſome of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in bonds for Chriſt and the Goſpel, he breaks out into this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: <hi>O miſerable me, who have been firſt in teaching theſe things, but laſt and perhaps never worthy to be a partaker of your bonds and fires.</hi> Oh labour for ſuch Grace: We think it much, if we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer; but we ſhould rejoyce in ſufferings, glory in the Croſs, carry our ſelves under ſufferings for Chriſt, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41049:94"/>looking upon them to be (for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed they are) an honour and privileg to us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For a man in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition, all things going ſmoothly with him in the world, to be willing to loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, We have general work to do the work of our Chriſtian calling, the work of our ſalvation, which we are commanded <hi>to work out with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. the work of Faith and the labour of Love, the work of Mortification, Self-denial, and the like. We have alſo,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Special work to do, the work of our particular Stations and places; work that is incumbent upon us, as we ſtand thus and thus related being Magiſtrates, or Miniſters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Truly this is the poſture which ſome (though but a few) are found in; they make conſcience to diſcharge the duty that is incumbent upon them; they ſay with their Lord, <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me, while it is day; for the night cometh, when no man can work,</hi> John 9.4. they ſee a Night coming, Death coming, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coming, Eternity coming; and accordingly they deſire to lay out their whole ſouls in the work of God, to live up to the Laws of Chriſt in every rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they look upon that day as loſt, wherein they have not done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for God and their own ſouls: and how comfortably may ſuch look death in the face, when it comes?

Oh ſtudy your own work? ſtudy the work and duty of your Chriſtian calling: ſtudy that work and duty which is incumbent upon you in your particular relations, and beg of God a heart to be diligent in the diſcharge of one and the other.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41049:97"/>fall our converſe and communion with God, and ſuffer ſad diſtances and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangements to grow up between him and us? And indeed (my Beloved) it is a ſad and amazing thing to think how ſuddenly and imperceptibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and eſtrangements will grow up between God and a mans ſoul: for my own part, ſhould I have heard of it only by the hearing of the ear, and had not found it by too many ſad and woful experiences, I could not have believed how ſuddenly and imperceptibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and eſtrangements will grow up between God and a mans ſoul, yea and that after the neareſt, livelieſt, and moſt intimate acquaintance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: which calls upon us to be very watchful and circumſpect, as to this thing; and (my Beloved) as you would die with boldneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, let me adviſe and perſuade you to give all diligence to keep up conſtant intercourſe and acquaintance with God, and watch narrowly againſt all diſtances between him and you. Which of us, that knows any thing of the things of God, knows not, that we ſuffer diſtances and eſtrangements to grow up between
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41049:97"/>God and us? we cannot tell how with any tolerable boldneſs and comfort to look him in the face in a duty, or ſcarce to think of him with delight; much leſs ſhall we be able to look him in the face with comfort in death, in caſe we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diſtances to grow up between him and us: moreover, take this for a ſure rule, That the more you are verſed in communion with God, and do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an holy intimacy and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, the more boldneſs and comfort you will have when you come to die; then you will be able to ſay, I am now going to be, and live for ever, immediately with that God with whom I have lived in much ſweet and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate communion here; I am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to converſe more fully with him in Heaven, with whom I have enjoyed much ſweet converſe here on Earth. Should death find a man under diſtances and eſtrangements between God and him, it muſt neceſſarily be uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him; but when there is an holy intimacy kept up between God and the ſoul, then the ſoul need not fear, or be aſhamed to look death and Judgment both in the face: <hi>Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>

We are put into Chriſt by Faith at our firſt Converſion; and we abide in him by after-acts of Faith and Communion; and this abiding in him is the way to have boldneſs before him at his coming: therefore mind this, and pray much about this; take heed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances growing up between God and you, and labour to have thoſe ſweet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, thoſe ſweet intercourſes of love, thoſe bleſſed acts of communion kept up between God and you, that are wont to be kept up between him and his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, cloſe walking Saints: and in order hereunto, take three or four ſhort hints.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41049:99"/>my whole reſt, ſolace, and ſatisfaction in thy ſelf alone: and alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on earth I deſire in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thee: my heart and my fleſh fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> The ſame ſpirit dwelt and acted in <hi>Auſtin, All fulneſs and plenty</hi> (ſays he) <hi>which is not my God, is want and poverty:</hi> And again, elſewhere, <hi>Thou, Lord, art my God, my happineſs; and unto thee, and after thee do I breathe and ſuſpire day and night.</hi> O (my Beloved) did we indeed prize communion with God more, we ſhould live more in communion with him; and this take for a certain truth, that it will never be well with us indeed, till we ſee all in God, and account we enjoy all happineſs in enjoying communion with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the cloſe of every day take a ſerious view of, and diligently conſider what hath paſſed between God and you, what tranſactions there have been between God and your ſouls that day: there doth not a day paſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there do not many things paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people; and he that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41049:99"/>wouuld prevent diſtances and eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between God and him, ſhould ſeriouſly ponder and lay to heart vvhat hath paſſed between God and his ſoul, vvhat tranfactions there hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and him that day. On the one hand ponder and conſider vvhat hath paſſed from God to you, and vvhat his carriage towards you hath been, vvhat approaches he hath made to you, vvhat intimations of love, vvhat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of communion, vvhat diſcoveries of himſelf and his glory; how far and in vvhat vvay God hath been dealing vvith your ſpirits, convincing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, quickening, or comforting of them; vvhat calls he hath given you, vvhat myrrhe he hath dropped upon the handle of the Lock, what taſtes you have had of his ſweetneſs and Grace, vvhat holy impreſſions he hath made upon you, and the like. On the other hand, ponder and conſider what hath paſſed from you to God, and what your carriages towards him have been, what reception and entertainment you have given him, making his approaches to you; what value you have put upon his preſence, and the intimations of his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41049:100"/>love: how far you have embraced and improved the overtures he made you of farther communion with him; what awe there hath been upon you of his holineſs, and his all-ſeeing eye; what out-goings of heart there have been found within you after him; what breathings of love, what holy longings and deſires, what ſpringings and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſpiritual joy, and delight of ſoul to him, and in him; what place he hath had in your thoughts and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how far you have lived to him, and upon him; wherein you may have either grieved or delighted his Spirit, and the like. Thus in the cloſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day ponder and conſider what hath paſſed between God and you, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly deport &amp; demean your ſelves before him; wherein you have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or been defective in any thing, in order to keeping up communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and you, be humbled, and ſet all right by Faith and Prayer; adore God in his acts of Grace and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as to be ſure you will find cauſe to do) and loath your ſelves, for any acts of ſin or unkindneſs, undutifulneſs or diſreſpect, that you have been guilty
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41049:100"/>of towards God: O this would be a bleſſed courſe indeed, to prevent diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and eſtrangements between God and you: This <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>a communing with his own heart;</hi> and enjoyns it as a duty of the higheſt importance; <hi>Stand in awe, and ſin not; commune with your hearts, and be ſtill,</hi> Pſal. 4.4. it is what he lived in the practice of, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77.6. (if he were the Author of that Pſalm) <hi>I communed with my own heart, and my Spirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> O be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in this work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Be much converſant, and that with all ſpiritual diligence, in the ways and duties of Communion; thoſe ways and duties wherein God is wont to meet his people, and maintain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and communion with them; and in all of them wait for God and his approaches to you: there are thoſe which we may call ways and duties of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ways and duties wherein God and his people do hold converſe with each other, wherein God viſits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf unto his people, and wherein his people may be ſaid to viſit God, and make out after God; and theſe are the uſe of the Word and Sacraments,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41049:101"/>the exerciſe of Prayer, Meditation, Self-examination, and the like: now, as ever you would prevent the growing up of diſtances and eſtrangements between God and you, ſee that you are much converſant in theſe, and that with a holy and ſpiritual diligence, waiting for God, and the manifeſtations of God to your ſouls in them; theſe are the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries wherein Chriſt and his People do take ſweet turns together; the green beds wherein they lie down in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of each others love: therefore keep up a conſtant and diligent attendance on God in theſe; and in all your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances on him, look after converſe with him, let it be your ſolemn aim to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, and ſee his face, to have a viſit, a ſmile, a deſcent of love from him. I do ſuppoſe you to be ſuch as do, and will attend on publick Ordinances, and wait for God there, as they waited for the Spirit at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> that only then which I would preſs you to, in this preſent caſe, ſhall be to be much converſant in Prayer and Meditation between God and your own ſouls; in theſe two great duties of communion with God, ſecret Prayer and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41049:101"/>Oh the loſs as to communion with God, that we expoſe our ſelves unto, by being no more in Prayer and holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation! The holy Ones of old, and thoſe that have been men of the higheſt communion with God, have alſo been men of much Prayer, and great Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as I might inſtance in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and others: and indeed their communion with God came in and was kept up this way: God (you know) hath told us, <hi>the Prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15.8. and Chriſt beſpeaks the Prayer of his Spouſe, as moſt pleaſing and delightful to him, Cant. 2.14. <hi>O my Dove! thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs: let me ſee thy countenance, and hear thy voice; for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Approach to me in ſcret Prayer, I will aſſure thee it will be moſt ſweet and pleaſant to me. And as he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the Prayers of his People, ſo he will ſurely delight them in their Prayers vvith the viſits of his Love, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of his Grace, the beamings out of his Glory to and upon their ſouls: he hath promiſed to <hi>make them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41049:102"/>joyful in the houſe of prayer;</hi> yea, he hath promiſed to perform the whole Grace of the New Covenant in anſwer to their prayers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. Oh the great things God doth for his People, and the ſweet communion that is kept up between him and them, in a way of Prayer! I remember a ſaying of one, <hi>He that is not much in prayer, will never be a man of much excellency:</hi> And I may as truly ſay, He that is not much in prayer, is never like to be a man of much communion with God. And ſo for Meditation: O how ſweet, how Heaven-like a duty is that! Oh how much of God is let out many times to the ſouls of his people herein! <hi>David</hi> experienced this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips; when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches:</hi> while he was converſant in this duty of Meditation, his ſoul was filled with joy and ſatisfaction, as with marrow and fatneſs: Again, ſaith he, <hi>my meditation of thee ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Pſ. 104.34. Oh be much and frequent with God in theſe ways and duties of communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:41049:102"/>
Fourthly, Give Chriſt his due place and honour, in all your makings out after communion with God. <hi>Joſeph</hi> told his Brethren, <hi>they ſhould not ſee his face, unleſs they brought their Brother</hi> Benjamin <hi>with them:</hi> and truly you are not like to ſee the face of God, in any of the fore-mentioned ways and duties, unleſs you bring Chriſt with you, and give him his due place and honour therein; that is to ſay, unleſs you eye him, and act Faith upon him, as the only way and medium of communion with God: Chriſt beſpeaks this at our hands, while he tells us, <hi>I am the way, the truth; and the life; no man cometh to the Father, but by me,</hi> John 14.6. and by his Blood it is, that we have a way opened to us into the Holy of Holies, acceſs for our Perſons and Prayers into the Divine Preſence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. yea, not only has he purchaſed a liberty, and opened a way for us to approach into the preſence of God; but having done this, by his Mediation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion it is, that any of us come to God: hence he is ſaid <hi>to ſave to the very uttermoſt all that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make interceſſion for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41049:103"/>us, Heb.</hi> 7.25. Indeed vvere it not for Chriſt, none of us could ever hope to ſee the face of God, and live; none of us could ever hope to ſee one ſmile of Gods face, one embrace of his boſom, any the leaſt deſcent and emanation of love from him: vvere it not for Chriſt, vvhen vve come unto God, vve ſhould find him to be a conſuming fire, and vvhen he and our ſouls did meet, it vvould be as the meeting of devouring fire, and vvithered ſtubble: in a vvord, all communications of Grace and Love from God to us, are by and through Chriſt; and all the Love, the Duty, the Homage vve tender to God, muſt be all tendered to him by and through Chriſt, if ever we find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation vvith him: have Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your eye in all your approaches unto God, as him <hi>by whom we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. Let the real language of your ſouls be, If I have any one ſmile from God, it muſt be upon the account of Chriſt, if he ſheweth himſelf pacified towards me, it muſt be through his blood; if he gives out any grace, any favour, any bleſſing to me, it vvill be upon the ſole account of his Mediation; if ever either my
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41049:103"/>perſon, or ſervices be accepted of the Lord, it muſt be in and through this Mediator: moreover, how great ſoever the diſtance between God and my ſoul is, yet Chriſt can bring me nigh unto him; and however unworthy of, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to communion with God I am in my ſelf, yet ſuch is his well-pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt, that well-beloved Son of his, that I will hope through him to find Grace in his ſight, and to be lodged in the boſom of his Love: Thus put all the honour upon Chriſt, that is due to him in this buſineſs; this is what is pleaſing to the Father: and the more you thus honour him, the fuller and more conſtant will your converſe and communion with God be.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Would you indeed have all right, and in order for a dying hour? would you be ready for that laſt and great work? then live wholly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon Chriſt, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for your juſtification and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, both living and dying: the more we live out of our ſelves upon Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and acceptation with God, the more ready poſture we are in for a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41049:104"/>hour: this indeed is the main thing, and when we have done all that ever we can, to deck and adorn our ſelves with Grace, and gracious diſpoſitions, ſtill we muſt live out of our ſelves, and out of all thoſe Ornaments, upon the naked righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation: This is that which the Scripture calls the readineſs of the Lambs Wife, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready:</hi> and wherein that readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lay, the next words tell you; <hi>To her was granted to he cloathed with fine linen, clean and white; which fine linen is the righteouſneſs of the Saints;</hi> that is, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to the Saints through believing; this is the <hi>beſt robe,</hi> mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 15.22. a robe indeed which covers all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, that beautifies and adorns us, and renders us moſt amiable in Gods eye: whatſoever ſpots and blemiſhes, whatever failings or defects may be upon us, yet theſe are not ſeen, while God looks upon us as cloathed with the righteouſneſs of his Son; and we by faith do live upon that righteouſneſs,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41049:104"/>as the ſole matter of our Juſtification and acceptation with him: and let me tell you, the more clear and diſtinct the actings of our Faith are, in carrying us out of our ſelves, and all ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and relying wholly on Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, the more ready and comfortable poſture we are in for a dying hour: This was the great thing <hi>Paul</hi> coveted, and preſſed after to the very laſt, and which he accounted all things but dung for, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>I count all things but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is by the Law, but the righteouſneſs of Faith, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> He dreaded the thoughts of being found in any thing of his own; he trembled to think of ſtanding upon his own bottom, the bottom of his own worth and righteouſneſs, when he ſhould come to die; and he cleaved intirely unto, and relied wholly upon Chriſt, and his moſt perfect righteouſneſs: Oh let me tell you, <hi>Paul</hi> had as much and perhaps more to have reſted upon, than ten thouſand of us; for gifts, for graces, for privileges, for ſervices, for ſucceſſes,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41049:105"/>for ſufferings for Chriſt, he went beyond any meer man that ever lived; and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves of him, That he feared nothing but ſin; to diſpleaſe God, and to diſhonour him, was the onely thing that was terrible to him; and the Scripture gives a large and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent account of his other attainments: but ſtill he goeth out of all, and his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt; not but that alſo he preſſeth after the greateſt eminency and exactneſs in holineſs, as you find in the following Verſes of this third to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> and indeed this is the true Spirit of the Goſpel, to preſs after the greateſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and exactneſs in holineſs; to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to attain, if poſſible, unto Angelical holineſs: and yet under, and after all, to live ſingly and entirely on a naked Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and acceptation with God: and the more you come to, and live in this Spirit, the more ready you are for Death and a bleſſed Eternity: this was a great part of the ground of the Churches rejoycing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God; for he hath cloathed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41049:105"/>me with the Garments of Salvation, and hath covered me with a Robe of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> which <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and others both Ancient and Modern, interpret of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: and indeed no greater ground of rejoycing to a man or woman, whether living or dying, than to be cloathed with the Robe of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put you in mind of a ſaying I have heard from a holy man the day before he died: <hi>My Friends</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ſelf and others) <hi>I have walked with God theſe thirty years, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a good meaſure of the aſſurance of his love: but now that I am come to die, I do not place my comfort on any of all theſe, but on the infinite ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Oh there, there, when we have done all, we muſt lay the weight and ſtreſs of our Souls, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Salvation, and all: and therefore be ſure you live out of your ſelves upon Chriſt. It is a great ſaying <hi>Luther</hi> hath to this purpoſe; <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art my righteouſneſs, and I am thy ſin: thou tookeſt mine,</hi> (meaning his ſin) <hi>and thou gaveſt me thine,</hi> (meaning his righteouſneſs:) <hi>thou tookſt that which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41049:106"/>thou waſt not, and thou gaveſt me that which I was not:</hi> intending the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that Chriſt had made with him, giving him his righteouſneſs for his ſin: Oh let this be the language of our ſouls to Chriſt; ſo ſhall we be ſound ready when a dying hour comes.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Would you indeed die with comfort? then beg God to ſtand by you, and give you actual Grace in a dying hour; and make it one of your great works to treaſure up many Prayers for this before-hand: When you have done all, ſhould God withdraw his preſence, and the influences of his Grace and Love from you when you come to die, Death would be in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to you: but if God will be with you, if God will ſtand by you, if he will vouchſafe you the influences and communications of his Grace in a dying hour, then how will your ſouls triumph over death? this indeed will ſweeten death: they are great words of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me:</hi> having the preſence of God with him, he was not, he would not be afraid,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41049:106"/>even in the very valley of the ſhadow of death: truly without the preſence of God, we cannot live comfortably; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our attainments in Grace have been, yet if God withdraw his preſence from us, we can do nothing, we can bear nothing, we cannot perform the leaſt duty, we cannot reſiſt the leaſt temptation, we cannot grapple with the leaſt corruption, nor carry through, as we ought, the leaſt difficulty: much leſs ſhall we be able to die with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if God withdraw: therefore, I ſay, beg God to ſtand by you in a dying hour: Let it be your daily prayer to God,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he would be with you in the difficulties of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he would not leave you in the conflicts and agonies of death. And indeed we ſhould not paſs that day wherein we do not treaſure up one prayer for this before-hand; and thus doing, God will not leave us, God will not fail us in that laſt and great difficulty; at leaſt he will not leave us in point of Grace: our Lord himſelf was left in the agonies of death by the Father, in point of comfort, which put him to that out-cry, <hi>Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41049:107"/>me?</hi> but he was not left by him in point of Grace, ſtill a Spirit of Faith and Holineſs acted him; and therefore though forſaken, he cries out, <hi>My God, my God:</hi> if poſſibly, in conformity to our Head, we ſhould be left in that hour in point of comfort, yet if we carry our ſelves as we ought, we ſhall not be left in point of Grace; and if we be not left in point of Grace, all will do well, though not ſo ſweet and joyous with us as otherwiſe it would be. And thus I have given you theſe more particular directions, in order to a preparation for a dying hour; which if you live up to, you may not only live above the fear of death, but alſo in the joyful expectation thereof daily.</p>

'tis Heaven is their home and Countrey: hence they have confeſt, and do <hi>confeſs themſelves to be Pilgrims and Strangers upon earth,</hi> Heb. 11.13. and the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the words immediately foregoing my Text, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.12. owns it to God, <hi>I am a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer and a ſtranger here:</hi> yea, this world is not onely a ſtrange land, but a waſte howling wilderneſs to ſuch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live among wild Beaſts, Lions, Bears, Wolves, Tygers, and the like: Luſts within, and Devils without, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy daily to devour them: but now when Death comes, that carries them off from this ſtrange land, this waſte howling wilderneſs, to their own home and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which is Heaven; yea to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, there to live with him, to enjoy his preſence, and to adore his grace. <hi>We know,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that when our earthly houſe of this tabernacle</hi> (ſpeaking of the Body) <hi>ſhall be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.

2. Death, whenever it comes, will carry thee from trouble to reſt, from a tempeſtuous Sea to a quiet Haven, there to lie at an eternal Anchor in the boſom of thy ſweet Lord. This world ever was, and (for any thing I know) ever will be a place of trouble to the people of God: ſure I am, Chriſt hath told us, <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation, Jo.</hi> 16.33. And who of us does not find it made good? This world is a tempeſtuous Sea, wherein the Waves lift up themſelves, and the poor Saints are <hi>afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>not comforted, Iſa.</hi> 54.11. We read in <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.13. that <hi>the Sea wrought, and was tempeſtuous, and the Mariners were fain to row hard to get the Ship to ſhore.</hi> And truly, thus 'tis often in the caſe in hand, the Sea of this world is tempeſtuous, it works, and the poor Saints are fain to row hard to get ſafe to ſhore; yea, as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.14. that <hi>an Euroclydon, a tempeſtuous Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind aroſe, and beat upon</hi> Paul, <hi>and others in the Ship with him,</hi> which was ready to break all in pieces: So truly the Saints in this world do meet with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclydons,</hi> tempeſtuous winds, not a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41049:112"/>few, which beat upon them, and are ready to ſplit all, and ſink all; but now, when death comes, thoſe ſtormes are all made a calm, and they (I mean the Saints) are brought into the deſired Haven: Death ſets them at reſt; 'tis indeed their diſmiſſion to reſt; <hi>There</hi> (ſays <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of the Grave) <hi>the weary be at reſt,</hi> Job 3.17. Death ſends the body to reſt, it frees it from all ſenſible ſufferings: when Death comes, thy weak body, thy ſick body, thy pained body, thy conſumptive body ſhall have its diſmiſſion to reſt; and Death ſends the ſoul to reſt, that reſts in God, and with God: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, henceforth they reſt from their labours,</hi> Rev. 14.13. and you have, I think, both together in one Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the righteous, 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds.</hi> Hence we read, that <hi>there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a reſt to the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9. indeed it remains, 'tis not here; but when death comes, that ſets them down in this remaining reſt. Oh what a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt this be? Reſt! O how ſweet is reſt? how deſirable is reſt? and reſt too
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41049:112"/>after long and hard labour and trouble? how ſweet is reſt to the labouring man, that hath wrought hand all the day? how ſweet is reſt to the weary traveller, that hath gone a long and dirty jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? how ſweet is reſt to the ſolicitous Mariner, and how welcom is the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to him, eſpecially after having been long toſs'd and beaten with ſtorms and tempeſts? and how ſweet will reſt be to the poor, troubled, tempted, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, travelling Saint, whoſe whole life has been little elſe but trouble, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſore travel; who here could ſcarce all his days find a reſting place for the ſole of his foot, the world as to him being covered with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Death, whenever it comes, will turn your conflicts into victory; this <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or Field of blood (for ſuch is this world) into a Mount of Triumph, and a Throne of Glory. What is this world but an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of blood, to the poor Saints? Sure I am, this life is little elſe but a perpetual war and conflict with luſts, with devils, with afflictions, and with temptations; hence 'tis call'd a <hi>fight; a warfare,</hi> and the like:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41049:113"/>and the enemies which they in this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare have to grapple with, are formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemies: <hi>We wreſtle not,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>with fleſh and blood, but with Principalities, and Powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes,</hi> Eph. 6.12, 13. We wreſtle not vvith fleſh and blood, that is, vvith men, or any thing that is frail and vveak, no, vve have more potent and formidable enemies to deal vvithal, vve vvreſtle and conflict vvith Devils, vvho are potent, ſubtile, and indefatigable: <hi>Enemies</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves upon the place) <hi>which wound before they appear, and kill before they are ſeen; Enemies which deal not onely by force and power, but who are dreadfully crafty and ſubtil, yea enemies which have fiery darts to caſt at us,</hi> as afterwards he ſpeaks: and for my own part, I think it vvere vvell for us, over what it is, if theſe vvere the vvorſt enemies vve had to grapple and conflict withal; but there are legions of luſts within (which I look upon to be vvorſe enemies) vvhich vve do and muſt vvreſtle vvith (inteſtine enemies are in many reſpects the vvorſt) theſe <hi>war againſt our ſouls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and vvere it not for theſe, all the Devils in Hell
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41049:113"/>could do us no hurt. Thus this life is to the Saints a vvarfare, a conflict; and O the vvounds, the bruiſes, the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vvhich they are expoſed unto in this War! now their Peace, and then their Grace; now their Comforts, and then their Conſciences are ſorely wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they lie a bleeding for days, and weeks, and months together; yea, ſometimes like him that vvas travelling from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> they are vvounded, and left half dead, and did not the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> paſs by, take compaſſion on them, and pour in of his Wine and Oyl, his Blood and Spirit, into their vvounds, they vvould ſoon be vvholly dead: Well, but now when Death comes, that puts an end to this War, and ſets them all down upon a Throne of Triumph: <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>will I grant to ſit with me upon my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſate down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. When death comes, then you begin an eternal Triumph with Chriſt; then the Palm vvill be put into your hands, and you ſhall triumphingly cry, Victory, Victory, for ever. O how ſweet vvill this be!
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41049:114"/>how ſweet is the Victory to a Souldier that has been long and hard put to it in the Battel? and indeed, the harder the Battel, the more glorious the Triumph. 'Tis a ſweet and a great ſaying which I have read in <hi>Aug.</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>The Conquerour,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>triumphs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had fought, he had never conquered and by how much the greater his danger and difficulty was in the battel, by ſo much the greater is his joy in the triumph.</hi> O Sirs, not only will death ſet you upon a Mount of Triumph; but know for your encouragement, the ſharper your conflicts and warfare have been here, the more glorious will your triumph be, when Death ſhall ſet you upon the Throne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Death, whenever it comes, will change your bondage into liberty, your ſpiritual thraldom into glorious, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and is not this a kindneſs? Poor ſoul, one thing which here thou bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and groaneſt under, is that ſpiritual bondage and thraldom which thou lieſt under: And indeed this world is no other than a Priſon, a Dungeon, an houſe of Bondage to thee, the Land of thy Captivity: Here thou lieſt in Chains
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41049:114"/>and Fetters, the Chains and Fetters of Sin and Guilt, yea, and the iron ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enters into my ſpirit. Hence we read of <hi>the bondage of corruption,</hi> which indeed is the foreſt bondage in the world, a worſe bondage ten thouſand times than that which <hi>Iſrael</hi> groaned and ſighed under in <hi>Egypt, who</hi> yet <hi>were made to ſerve with rigour, and whoſe lives were made bitter with hard bondage, Exod.</hi> 1.13, 14. Truly this luſt, and the other luſt, this corruption, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corruption, are as ſo many Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, cruel Task-maſters, which make thee ſerve with rigour, and thy life bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thee with hard bondage: and oh how doſt thou groan and ſigh under the bondage of a proud, dead, hard, carnal, unbelieving heart, an heart bent to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from God? And indeed, who that is ſenſible of it, can but groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? This drew that heavy groan from <hi>Paul,</hi> and bitter out-cry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> ſays he: Why <hi>Paul,</hi> what is the matter? Oh, ſays he, <hi>I find a law in my members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin and death.</hi> I am by ſin brought into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41049:115"/>captivity to ſin, and I have a body of ſin and death lying heavy upon me, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than a Mountain of Braſs or Iron; and who can but groan? and as 'twas with him, ſo 'tis with all the Saints in their meaſure: Well, but when death comes, Sirs, that will turn all this your boudage into liberty, yea into <hi>the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. that will turn again this your cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: And oh how ſweet will, that be? You have ſome little taſtes of this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here; for <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. and the taſtes of it are ſweet, very ſweet; but O how ſweet vvill the full enjoyment on't be? <hi>Paul</hi> breaks out into praiſes in the faith of it before-hand, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 7.25. O ſoul, how ſhould this make thee long for Death? Can a Priſon, can an houſe of Bondage, can a ſtate of thraldom be pleaſant to thee? Canſt thou be vvell-pleaſed to lie in chains and fetters of ſin and guilt? Shouldeſt thou not rather vvelcom that vvhich alone vvould vvork thy deliverance?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Death, whenever it comes, will be the death of all your ſins, and the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41049:115"/>perfection of all your graces? and will not that be a kindneſs? Poor Saint, how doſt thou here bleed and groan under the ſenſe of the life and vigour of thy ſins on the one hand, and of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imperfection of thy graces on the other hand? yea, how great are the conflicts and holy contentions of thy ſpirit, to kill and bring down the one, and to quicken and perfect the other? How doſt thou, with the holy Apoſtle of old, <hi>forgetting thoſe things which are behind, follow after, that thou mayſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that for which alſo thou art ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt Jeſus, preſſing towards the mark, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 3.12, 13, 14. O the watchings, the warrings, the wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of thy ſoul for more grace, more holineſs, more victory over, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſin! Oh the many prayers and tears, ſighs and groans that thou poureſt out between God and thy ſoul, in order hereunto! Theſe things are the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy life; yea, and after all, ſin is ſtill ſtrong and lively, and grace is ſtill weak and imperfect; the ſenſe of which breaks thy heart almoſt, and makes thee go mourning all the day long: What daily cleanſing thy ſelf,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41049:116"/>and yet ſtill unclean? daily perfecting holineſs, yet ſtill imperfect? Oh hovv fad is this? Well, but Soul, vvhen death comes, things vvill be ſtrangely alter'd vvith thee; that vvill do that for thee in one moment, vvhich thou by a vvhole life of prayers, tears, faith, vvatching, vvarring, labouring, couldſt not do; 'tvvill make thee perfect: Hence thoſe above are ſaid to be ſo, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. then <hi>all that is imperfect will be done away, and that which is prefect ſhall come,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.10. perfect grace, perfect holineſs: Novv there is much lacking in thy faith, thy love, thy obedience, thy humility, thy heavenlineſs, thy joy and delight in God; but death, vvhen it comes, vvill make up all in a moment: yea, novv thou art ſtained and defiled vvith ſin, and this luſt and the other luſt ſtirs, and vvorks, and vvars vvithin thee; but vvhen death comes, that vvill purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay all: Death is the Saints only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cleanſer through Chriſt: Indeed 'tis ſaid of vvicked men and hypocrites, that <hi>their iniquites ſhall lie down with them in the duſt,</hi> Job 20.11. vvhich is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vvord indeed: Death does not kill
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41049:116"/>their ſins; no, they live in the grave; they go vvith them into the other vvorld, and vvill there live in them for ever; vvhich vvill be a great part of their torment: 'twill be indeed (however they may now think of it) the one half of hell: for vvhat is hell, but ſin at the higheſt, and vvrath at the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt? but though it be thus vvith vvick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, yet 'tis otherwiſe vvith the Saints; Death, through the Grace of Chriſt, vvill for ever put a period to your ſin, and perfect your graces: Oh ſweet! vvho vvould not vvelcom death?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Death, vvhenever it comes, vvill ſet thee above all afflictive diſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, Chriſt, the Comforter, and thee, and vvill ſet down thy ſoul in the full, conſtant, and immediate viſion and fruition of all for ever; and is not this ſvveet? Poor Saint, here thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt, that <hi>God is as a ſtranger to thee, and as a way faring man, that turneth aſide to tarry but for a night:</hi> Thou haſt only novv and then a ſhort viſit from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. Thou complaineſt that <hi>thy Beloved withdraws himſelf, and is gone,</hi> Cant. 5.6. Thou complaineſt that <hi>the Comforter that ſhould relieve thy ſoul
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41049:117"/>is far from thee,</hi> Lam. 1.18. thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of many ſad and woful diſtances from God, and of the lowneſs of thy communion, and well thou maiſt; for indeed, how little a portion is there here ſeen, or enjoyed of him by thee? well, but when death comes, that will lift thee above all thoſe diſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thee, Chriſt and thee, and ſet thee down in the full, conſtant, and immediate viſion and fruition of him for ever; the thoughts of which made <hi>Paul,</hi> and others, to deſire to be gone, and to chuſe death rather than life, 2 Cor. 7.6, 7, 8. <hi>We are confident</hi> (ſays he) <hi>knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by ſight: we are confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Pray obſerve, <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyed as much of God and Chriſt here, as moſt did; and yet all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion he enjoyed here, he accounted as no communion, to that which he ſhould enjoy after death, <hi>While we are preſent in the body,</hi> ſays he, that is, while we live in this world, <hi>we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> abſent from God and Chriſt, our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41049:117"/>communion here is but diſtance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement, ſo low and unconſtant is it, in compariſon of what we know we ſhall enjoy after death; and therefore, ſays he, we had rather be abſent from the body, we had rather be gone hence, and be preſent with the Lord: Death will bring us to anothergueſs preſence and enjoyment of God and Chriſt, than here we ſhall ever be able to reach unto. Alas! all we enjoy of God and Chriſt here, is but as an earneſt; ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the verſe foregoing: <hi>He that hath wrought us for this ſelf-ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given us the earneſt of the ſpirit:</hi> but when Death comes, we ſhall enjoy the full inheritance: all we enjoy here is but as the firſt-fruits; <hi>we that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. but when death comes, we ſhall have the full vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, full incomes of love, full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of light, and life, and glory, <hi>fulneſs of joy and pleaſure</hi> in the Divine Preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. full embraces in Chriſts boſom, full views of his face, full viſions of his glory. Death, when it comes, will bring us to the Beatifical Viſion, which is all good and happineſs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41049:118"/>in one; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. They do ſee God now, they ſee him by Faith, and thoſe ſights of him are ſweet, glorious, ſoul-raviſhing, and transforming ſights: but after death they ſhall have other ſights of him, ſuch ſights of him as will even infinitely ſurpaſs all that ever they had, or were capable of here. Here <hi>they ſee him but through a glaſs darkly,</hi> that is, they have but low, obſcure, mediate ſights of him, they ſee and enjoy but little of him; but when death comes, then <hi>they ſhall ſee him face to face,</hi> that is, fully, clearly, immediately, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. The ſum is, as a learned man gives it us, that <hi>in this life we have but low and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſights and enjoyments of God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what we ſhall ſee, know, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of him in eternal life.</hi> Glaſ. Rhet. Here they ſee but his back parts, as God ſaid to <hi>Moſes;</hi> but when death comes, they ſhall ſee his face, that is, his glory: here they ſee him but negatively, as it were, what he is not; but then they ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> in all his glorious excellencies and perfections. In ſhort, they ſhall then have ſuch ſights and enjoyments of God
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41049:118"/>and Chriſt, as ſhall eternally fill, delight, ſolace, ſatisfie, and ſet at reſt their ſouls for ever; ſuch ſights and enjoyments as ſhall ſo ſolace and ſatisfie them, as that there ſhall not be room for the leaſt tittle or <hi>iota</hi> of a deſire for ever; yea, ſuch ſights and enjoyments as ſhall ſo ſatisfie them, as to leave them under an utter impoſſibility of ever turning aſide from them to any thing elſe, and ſo an eternal impoſſibility of ſinning. Oh how ſweet muſt this be! and indeed the School-men I find, and others from them, give this as one reaſon, why the Saints in heaven are impeccable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſight and enjoyment they have of God there, is ſo full and ſatisfying, as that they cannot turn aſide to any thing elſe. O welcom death, that brings us to thoſe ſights, thoſe enjoyments of God, the Chief Good. Once more:</p>
               <p n="7">7. Death, when ever it comes, will bring you to, and ſet you down in the enjoyment of an eternal Sabbath: and oh how ſweet is this! <hi>There remaineth a Reſt</hi> (the word is, <hi>a Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>) <hi>to the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9. Ay, but when ſhall they enjoy it? why truly, when death comes, that will enter
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41049:119"/>them upon it: immediately, upon the night of death, dawns the eternal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. True, the Saints enjoy a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath here, and the Sabbath to them is the ſweeteſt and amiableſt day in all the week, 'tis a day of joy and holy feaſting to their ſouls; and oh how many times do your ſouls long for it? but alas theſe Sabbaths have an end: but the Sabbath death will ſet them down in, will be an eternal Sabbath, and an eternal Sabbath, wherein they ſhall be employed in the higheſt acts of worſhip and adoration, even Love, Praiſe, Admiration, and Halleluja's for ever; wherein there will be no wearineſs, no faintneſs; wherein there ſhall be no intermiſſion, no going to duties, and break off again, as here we do; but an whole Eternity ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in acts of Divine Worſhip and Adoration; wherein there ſhall be no deadneſs, no dulneſs, no ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions, no unſuitableneſs in us to thoſe high and holy Exerciſes which this Sabbath will be fill'd with; but our ſouls ſhall be perfectly ſuited to, and fitted for thoſe glorious employs; wherein not a few only, and thoſe ſome Saints and ſome ſinners, ſome good and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41049:119"/>ſome bad, ſhall joyn together in acts of worſhip; but an innumerable company both of Saints and Angels, and theſe all perfectly holy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. Oh how ſweet and glorious will this be! 'Tis a great ſaying which I have read in a worthy Divine, <hi>Sabbaths here are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and we have taſted ſome ſweet, ſome comfort in ſome Sabbaths; but take all the comfort that ever you had in all the Sabbaths you have enjoyed here, and all will be nothing to the comforts and ſweetneſs of the Eternal Sabbath.</hi> Alas! the perpetual Sabbath that ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that will be the accompliſhment of all theſe Sabbaths; how ſweet then muſt that be! Oh ye Saints of God, lift, up your heads, death will ſet you down in this Sabbath. How have ſome of us longed ſometimes for the coming of the Sabbath! and how have we grieved when it has been gone! well, but when death comes, that will bring you to a Sabbath that ſhall never end. 'Tis a ſweet ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, There</hi> (ſays he, ſpeaking of Heaven) <hi>is the great Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, a Sabbath that hath no evening, no end, in which we ſhall reſt and behold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and love, love and praiſe for ever.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:41049:120"/>Oh bleſſed be God for this Sabbath: and bleſſed be God that death, when it comes, ſhall bring us to this Sabbath. Well then, fear not death, dread not death, but be found diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the uſe of the helps preſcribed for the preparing of your ſouls for it; and then 'twill greatly befriend you, when ever it comes, and you may exult and rejoyce in it.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now conclude, but I muſt firſt beg all that read this plain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, deeply and frequently to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and contemplate theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every day ſeriouſly conſider and contemplate the exceeding worth of your ſouls, and the great things they are capable of: 'tis ſad to think what low thoughts the moſt of men have of their ſouls: they are content to ſell their ſouls, to loſe their ſouls, to damn their ſouls, and all for a luſt, for a little of this world, a little carnal ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight here, which is but for a moment. That rebuke which <hi>Auſtin</hi> gave one, is due to the moſt; <hi>How comes it to paſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that among all thy good things, thou wilt let nothing be in an ill caſe but thy ſelf, thy Soul?</hi> Truly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41049:120"/>the moſt of men are ſolicitous to have all well but their Souls; they will have it go well with their Bodies, their Names, their Eſtates, their Families, but their Souls they mind not: But, my Beloved, I beſeech you think deeply and frequently of the worth of your ſouls, and the concerns of them: O 'tis your ſoul that is your principal part; Chriſt who beſt knew the worth of ſouls, tells you that the whole World is nothing to one ſoul; and that the gain of the one can't recompence the loſs of the other, no not in the leaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. and you know what a price he was pleaſed to pay for ſouls, even his own Blood, his precious Blood, Life and all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Beſides, there are two things which ſpeak the ſoul to be a thing of unſpeakable worth and value: its vaſt capacity, and its abſolute immortality. (1.) The capacity of the ſoul ſpeaks its worth: Oh what great things is the ſoul of man capable of? there is a kind of infiniteneſs, as a worthy Divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, in the ſoul of man, 'tis capable of even an infinite happineſs, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſery; 'tis capable of eternal life, or eternal death; 'tis capable of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41049:121"/>communications both of love and wrath, and muſt one day be fill'd with the one or the other of them; 'tis capable of knowing God, of bearing his Image, of enjoying glorious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, yea of living Gods own life, and in a participation of his own bleſſedneſs: look whatever the Angels enjoy, look whatever the humane ſoul of Chriſt enjoys, that thy ſoul is capable of the enjoyment of: Sinner, O how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious does this ſpeak it to be! and how great ſhould thy concern be for it while day and ſeaſon laſts! contemplate it therefore a little, and ſay, O how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is my ſoul, and what great things is it capable of! and it being ſo, why do I take up in ſuch low, poor, dungy, droſſy things, as the beſt of ſin and this world are? (2dly) The immortality of the ſoul argues its worth, the ſoul that never dies; 'tis indeed but as it were a ſpark, a beam of God's own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality breathed into the body, at leaſt there is a ſtamp and impreſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon it: the body, that dies, that returns to duſt; but the ſoul, that lives, that goes to God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. As the mortality of the body, as a Learned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41049:121"/>man obſerves, ſo the immortality of the ſoul is here aſſerted. Beſides, <hi>Abraham Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with the reſt of the good old Patriarchs, and Servants of God, who died long ſince, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding living ſtill; ſo Chriſt argues you know, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32, that is, their ſouls live, as indeed do the ſouls of all that are gone hence; their ſouls all live ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in happineſs or miſery, with God or Devils, and ſo muſt thine and mine, Sinner; when our body ſhall be eaten by the worms, our ſouls will live either in Heaven or Hell: Oh think of this, daily contemplate and ſay, I have a ſoul within me that muſt live for ever, and that as filled with even an infinite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery; I have a ſoul within me that is capable of unſpeakable joys, or unconceivable torments, and in the one or the other it will, it muſt live for ever: why then am I not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seriouſly contemplate, and daily ſoak your ſpirits in the thoughts of the wonderful weight and importance of Eternity, the greatneſs of the concern of the other world. O Eternity, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! O vaſt, great, boundleſs Eternity!
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41049:122"/>how ſhall I do to ſpeak of thee? how are my thoughts loſt, and my ſpirit overwhelmed, when I ſet my ſelf to contemplate, how great, how weighty a thing thou art? an endleſs, boundleſs, bottomleſs ſtate; a ſtate that admits of neither change, pauſe, or period for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; a ſtate of unconceivable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery; happineſs in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or miſery in the loſs of, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from God and Chriſt for ever; happineſs in the fruition of infinite love, or miſery in the revelation of infinite wrath? one of which every ſoul muſt be the object of for ever. Eternity! ſuch is the weight of it in it ſelf, that indeed we know not how to conceive of it, every thing but Eternity has an end, a laſt: ſo innumerable as the ſtars of Heaven are, yet there is a laſt Star, and the number of them has an end, though we cannot reach it: ſo innumerable as the Sands on the Sea-ſhore are, yet there is a laſt Sand and the number of them has an end, could we reach to it: ſo numerous as the piles of Graſs, which are now, and from the Creation of the world have been, and to the end of the world ſhall be, are, yet there is an end
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41049:122"/>of the number of them, could we reach it; there is a laſt pile, a laſt ſpire of Graſs: ſo innumerable as the grains of Corn, in all the Harveſts that ever were, or ſhall be, are, yet the number of them has an end, though we cannot reach it and there is a laſt grain: ſo innumerable as all the drops of Rain that ever did fall, or ſhall fall upon the Earth, from the Creation to the end of the world, are, yet ſtill there is a laſt drop, yea, and that though all the drops contained in the wide and deep Sea be added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: ſo innumerable as the children of men have been, are, and ſhall be, to the end of all things: ſo innumerable as all the hairs of the head of them all have been, are, and will be: ſo innumerable as all the thoughts of the hearts of all throughout all Ages have been, are, and will be: ſo innumerable as all the Bruits and Animals, which both the Earth and the Sea have brought forth, do and will bring forth, are and will be, yet ſtill the number of them has an end, could we reach it, and there is a laſt man, a laſt hair, a laſt thought, a laſt animal: ſhould all the vaſt Body of the Heavens, which our eyes behold, be full written
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41049:123"/>with figures by the hand of an Angel; yet the number of thoſe figures would have an end, and there would be a laſt figure: but as for Eternity, that has no end, no laſt: could all thoſe vaſt numbers prementioned be put together into one, who could in the leaſt conceive of the thouſand thouſandth part of it? yet all this were nothing to Eternity, no not the thouſand thouſandth part of it. Thus Eternity is unconceivably weighty in it ſelf, and 'tis Eternity indeed that puts weight into all other things: 'tis Eternity that puts weight into the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: what were that Judgment, but that 'tis Eternal Judgment? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 2. 'Tis Eternity that puts weight indeed into the happineſs and joys of heaven: what were that happineſs, and thoſe joys, were they not Eternal? hence 'tis cal'd <hi>Eternal life, Eternal glory, a never-fading Crown, an everlaſting Kingdom, joy and pleaſure for evermore:</hi> So (you know) the Scripture ſpeaks of it, as that which is its Crown and perfection: hence we read of <hi>being for ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. to be with the Lord is ſweet; <hi>Peter</hi> found it ſo; all the Saints in their meaſure find it ſo here: but to be with the Lord
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41049:123"/>[for ever,] that makes it infinitely ſweet indeed: thus and thus [for ever] in the boſom of my Father's love, and there [for ever] in the views of my Redeemers glory, and there [for ever] joyned in with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, in loving, praiſing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, adoring, and ſinging Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs to God and the Lamb; and this [for ever;] to be fully ſwallowed up in the Divine life, the Divine will, the Divine preſence, the Divine fulneſs, and this [for ever;] to be ſet above all fin, to be delivered from an unavoidable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſinning, to an abſolute impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſinning, and this [for ever.] O how ſweet, how glorious is this! this one word <hi>Eternity,</hi> or for ever, is that which puts great ſweetneſs into it. Again, 'tis Eternity that indeed puts weight into the miſeries and torments of the damned: what were the fire of Hell, were it not unquenchable fire? what were the Worm there, were it not a never-dying Worm? when the Scripture would ſpeak of the exceeding greatneſs and ſeverity of thoſe torments, (you know) 'tis in this language: <hi>There the worm never dies, and the fire is

Moſt weighty is the meditation which I have read in a learned and holy man to this purpoſe: <hi>O Eternity! Eternity! O never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ending Eternity! O Eternity that can be meaſured by no ſpaces of time, that can be perceived or apprehended by no humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect or underſtanding! how unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably doſt thou augment the torments of the damned!</hi> And but a few lines after, he again cries out; <hi>O Eternity! Eternity! thou and thou alone doſt aggravate the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the puniſhment of the damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all meaſure.</hi> Heavy is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned becauſe of its ſharp neſs, its extenſiveneſs, its univerſality, there being all plagues and puniſhments in it; but ſays he, it is moſt heavy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its Eternity. Oh 'tis this indeed that makes it intollerably great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. O not only to be baniſhed from God and Chriſt, to be driven from the Beatifical Viſion, but to be baniſhed and driven from hence for ever. O doleful! to be in the flames, to ſuffer the vengeance of Eternal fire, to be ſinning, and always
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41049:125"/>bearing the puniſhment of ſin, and all this [for ever;] O this makes it out of meaſure heavy, thus, and always thus, under the wrath of God, and for ever ſo! this puts weight into it. Thus you ſee a little of the weight of Eternity, O contemplate it daily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider and contemplate how dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it will be to miſcarry for ever; and on the other hand what a wide door of mercy there is open to you, &amp; the fair opportunity you have of making a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed proviſion for your ſouls and eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider and contemplate how dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it will be to miſcarry for ever, to periſh eternally; the more worth there is in the ſoul, &amp; the greater weight there is in Eternity, the more doleful it will be to periſh or miſcarry, as to the intereſt of them: to miſcarry in our Eſtate, in our trade, in our name, in the change of our condition in this world, or the like, this is ſad, and ſinks many; but Oh what is this to the miſcarriage of the ſoul for ever! what is this to a miſerable Eternity, to the loſs of God, of Chriſt, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, of Heaven, and Eternal life? what is this to the wrath of God, to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Eternal fire, to utter darkneſs,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41049:126"/>to blackneſs of darkneſs for ever. O Sirs! to have infiniteneſs and Eternity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined againſt you to make you miſerable and to be for ever as miſerable as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs and eternity can make you, (as aſſuredly you will, in caſe you neglect to make proviſion for your ſouls, and the future life) O how dreadful, how doleful will this be! and what bitter lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will it fill you with for ever! Did <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> weep when he had loſt his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right? and did <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> upbraid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and bewail his folly, for parting with his Kingdom for a draught of water? O then how will you weep and wail, and even tear and torment your ſelves for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for your ſin and folly, when you ſhall find, that for a little of this world, for the ſatisfaction of a luſt, for a few dreggy, droſſy pleaſures, and ſenſual delights, or perhaps through a mere ſloth of ſpirit, you have loſt your ſouls and have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged your ſelves into an infinite Ocean of Eternal woe and miſery, whence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is no redemption for ever for you! Pray lay that Scripture to heart now, <hi>Lu.</hi> 13.27, 28. <hi>Depart from me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>all ye workers of iniquity:</hi> Depart, here is the Doom that will paſs at laſt upon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41049:126"/>every unrepenting, unbelieving ſinner, every ſoul that makes not ready for a dying hour; well, and what then? <hi>there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you thruſt out.</hi> O Sirs, when you ſhall ſee ſuch and ſuch lodged ſafe in Heaven, in the Boſom of Chriſt, and your ſelves ſhut out; and not only ſo, but caſt into utter darkneſs, as you have it added, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.12. when you ſhall ſee your ſelves ſhut up in the infernal Pit, and there ſeal'd up under Gods eternal wrath; O then ye will weep and gnaſh your teeth indeed; then your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be eternally a ſecond Hell to you, tearing and tormenting your ſouls in the remembrance of your ſin and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in neglecting to prepare for, and make ſure of a better ſtate. Think of theſe things ere it be too late.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider and contemplate what a wide Door of Mercy there is open to you, and what a fair opportunity God gives you, to make a bleſſed proviſion for your ſouls and Eternity. What ſhall I ſay? why Sirs, the way of Salvation is made plain to you, and you are daily
